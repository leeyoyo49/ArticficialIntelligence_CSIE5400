<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are a professor of Artificial Intelligence. The following input is an image of a lecture slide.

When explaining the slide, speak in a clear, pedagogical style appropriate for graduate students. Your explanation should include:
1. Every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets with full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.  
2. A detailed narrative of at least 300 words that walks students through the key ideas on the slide.  
3. At least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide, highlighted and briefly defined.  
4. If the slide shows a plot, a concise description of what the plot illustrates and how it supports the slide's message.  
5. If the slide contains any formulas, present them in LaTeX format and then unpack each component, explaining its meaning and role in context.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Sequence to Sequence Generation with Transformer Based Models" and is the ninth slide in the presentation. It introduces the concept of sequence-to-sequence generation using transformer models, which are a type of neural network architecture. The slide is divided into two main sections: the textual content and the visual representation of the encoder-decoder architecture.

1. **Textual Content:**
   - **Input:** The slide specifies that the input to the model is a sequence of elements, denoted as X1, ..., XT. This represents a series of data points or tokens that the model will process.
