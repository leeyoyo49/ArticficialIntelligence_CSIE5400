1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "BERTScore Architecture" and discusses the architecture of BERTScore, a metric used to evaluate the quality of text generated by models. The slide is divided into three main sections: Contextual Embedding, Pairwise Cosine Similarity, and Maximum Similarity with optional Importance Weighting.

In the first section, Contextual Encoding, the slide explains that the similarity between contextual embeddings of reference and candidate sentences is measured using cosine similarity. The reference sentence is "the weather is cold today" and the candidate sentence is "\underline{it is freezing today}". Both sentences are represented by images of a cartoon character with different facial expressions.

The second section, Pair-wise Cosine Similitude, shows a matrix of cosine similarity values between the words in the reference sentence and candidate sentence. The words "the", "weather", "is", "cold", and "today" are compared, with the highest similarity value being 0.913 between "it" and "freezing".

The third section, Maximum Similarity, presents a table of maximum similarity values for each word in the sentences. The highest value is 8.88 for the word "today".

The slide also includes a formula for calculating the BERT score, which is a weighted sum of the maximum similarity scores. The formula is: R_BERT = (0.713×1.27)+(0.515×7.94)+(1.82+7.90+1.88+8.8) / (1.2 +7.9 +1.8 +8.9).

The keywords from this slide are BERT, BERTscore, Architecture, Cosine similarity, Maximum similarity, Importance weighting, Reference sentence, Candidate sentence, and Contextual embedding.

There is no plot shown on the slide.
