<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "AI Weekly" and is part of a presentation on "Towards Long-Horizon Vision-Language Navigation: Platform, Benchmark and Method". The presentation is scheduled for June 11-15, 2025, and is associated with CVPR (Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition).

The slide provides an example of a long-horizon vision-language navigation task. The task is to "Take the backpack from the bedroom to the couch in the living room, then retrieve a book from the dining table." This task is visually represented by two images. The first image shows a cluttered bedroom with a backpack on the floor. The second image is a floor plan of a house showing the path to take the backpack, turn left for the couch, and then turn left again for the book.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, it does contain an example that could be used to explain the concept of vision-language tasks in artificial intelligence. These tasks require an AI system to understand and execute instructions that involve both visual understanding of the environment and language comprehension of the instructions.

Keywords: AI Weekly, CVPR, Vision-Langage Navigation, Long-Hour Vision, Benchmarks, Method, Backpack, Bedroom, Couch, Living Room, Book, Dining Table, Floor Plan, Cluttered Room, Path, Turn Left, Retrieve.

The formula is not present on the slide, so it cannot be provided.
