The slide is titled "Masked Self-Attention Layer" and discusses the concept of preventing vectors from looking at future vectors and setting future alignment scores to negative infinity. The slide includes a diagram of a masked self-attention layer, which is a component of the Transformer model in artificial intelligence. The diagram shows the flow of data through the layer, with input vectors being transformed into output vectors through a series of operations. The operations include a softmax function and an attention mechanism, which are used to calculate the alignment scores between input vectors.
