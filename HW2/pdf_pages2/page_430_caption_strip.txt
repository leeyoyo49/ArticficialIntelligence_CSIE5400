The slide is titled "Artificial Intelligence" and contains a diagram illustrating the process of training a neural network. The diagram is divided into three main components: the Target Network, the Prediction Network, and the Input. The Target Network is represented by a box labeled "Q'" and is connected to the Input through a curved arrow, indicating the flow of data. The Prediction Network is another box labeled with "Q" and is also connected to both the Target and Prediction Networks through straight arrows. The Input box is at the bottom of the diagram, serving as the starting point for the data flow.

The diagram also includes a mathematical formula at the top, which represents the loss function used to update the parameters of the networks during training. The formula is "r + γ max Q(s', a'; θ_i^-1) - Q(s, a; θ_i)", where "r" is the reward, "γ" is a discount factor, "max" indicates the maximum value, "Q(s',a';θ_i^-) " is the target network's output, and "s, a, θ_i" are the state, action, and weights of the prediction network, respectively.

The slide also mentions that the parameter update occurs at every C iterations, suggesting that the training process is iterative and the parameters are updated periodically.

The keywords that can be extracted from this slide are: Artificial Intelligence, Neural Network, Training, Loss Function, Reward, Discount Factor, Maximum Value, State, Action, Weights, Iterations, and Parameter Update.

The plot in the slide is a flowchart that visually represents the process and components involved in training an artificial neural network, including the input data, the target and prediction networks, the mathematical formula used for updating the network's parameters.

The formula in the image is saved in LaTex format as follows:
```latex
r + \gamma \max Q(s^{\prime} , a^{ \prime } ; \theta _ { i } ^ { - 1 } ) - Q ( s , a ;  \theta_i )
```
This formula is used to calculate the loss between the predicted Q-value and the target Q-value, which is then used to adjust the weights of both the target (Q') and prediction (Q) networks during the training phase. The discount factor (γ) is a hyperparameter that determines the importance of future rewards in the learning process.
