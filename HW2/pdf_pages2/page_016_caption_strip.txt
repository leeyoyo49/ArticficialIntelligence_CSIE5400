The slide is titled "The Transformer Encoder Block (2/5)" and is the 16th slide in the presentation. The main content of the slide is a diagram of a transformer encoder block, which is a part of the transformer model used in artificial intelligence. The diagram is divided into two sections: the transformer encoder on the left and a zoomed-in view of one encoder block on the right. The transformer encoder consists of multiple layers, each represented by a blue rectangle. Each layer has an input and an output, indicated by arrows. The input consists of a sequence of tokens, represented by purple rectangles with numbers inside them. The output is a transformed version of the input, also represented by blue rectangles. The slide also includes a URL as the source of the content.

The slide does not contain any written content such as bullet points or definitions, nor does it contain any formulas or inline examples. There is no plot shown on the slide.

The keywords related to the slide are: Transformer, Encoder, Block, Input, Output, Tokens, Layers, Sequence, Transformed, Model, Artificial Intelligence, Diagram, URL, Source.

The formula is not visible on the image, so it cannot be described.
