<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Examples of Self-Verification" and is divided into four sections, each containing an inventory list, a task, a reasoning process, and a success or critique statement. The inventories list items such as 'oak_planks', 'cobblestone', 'porkchop', 'wooden_sword', 'coal', 'oak_log', 'dirt', 'raw_copper', 'acacia_planks' and so on. The tasks include mining coal ore, crafting a spyglass, killing sheep, and killing a zombie. The reasoning process involves using GPT-4 to analyze the inventory and determine the success or failure of the task based on the items present. For example, in the first inventory, the task is to mine 5 coal ores, and the reasoning concludes that it is successful because there are 5 coals in the inventory. In the second inventory, there are not enough amethyst shards to craft a spyglass, leading to a critique to find and mine an amethyst shard underground. The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. The keywords from this slide could be "Self-Verification", "Inventory", "Task", "Reasoning", "Success", "Critique", and "GPT-4".
