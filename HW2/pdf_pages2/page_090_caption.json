<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "A Running Example (2/4)" and is divided into three main sections: "Automatic Curriculum," "Iterative Prompting Mechanism," and "Skill Library." 

The "Automatic Curriculum" section shows a flowchart with four steps: "Mine Wood Log," "Combat Zombie," "Make Crafting Table," and a new task that is not fully visible. Each step is represented by an image from the game Minecraft, indicating the actions to be taken in the game.

The "Iteractive Prompting Mechanism" section contains a code snippet written in Python. The code defines an asynchronous function named "combatZombie" that takes a bot as an argument. The function checks if the bot has a sword in its inventory. If it does, the bot equips the sword. If not, the function waits for the bot to craft a stone sword. There are ellipses indicating that there are more steps in the function that are not shown.

The slide also includes a list of skills that can be retrieved by the bot, such as "Make Wood Log Craft Table," "Craft Stone Sword," "Forge Furnace," "Create Shield," "Cook Steak," and the ability to "Combat Zombies."

There is no plot shown on the slide, and there is no formula to be saved in LaTex format. However, the code snippet can be described as follows:

```python
async function combatZombie(bot) {
  // Equip a weapon
  const sword = bot.inventory.findInventoryItem("stone_sword").id;
  if (sword) {
    await bot.equip(sword, "hand");
  } else {
    // Craft and equip a shield
    await craftShield(bot);
    // ... additional steps not shown
  }
}
```

The keywords that can summarize the slide are: "Running Example," "Automatic," "Curriculum," "Mining," "Zombie Combat," "Coding," "Python," "Game," "Minecraft," "Function," "Asynchronous," "Sword," "Shield," "Skill," "Inventory."

The summary of the slide is as follows: The slide presents a running example of an automatic curriculum for a bot in a Minecraft game. The curriculum includes mining wood logs, combatting zombies, and making crafting tables. The slide also shows an iterative prompting mechanism in the form of a Python function that equips the bot with a sword or crafts one if it doesn't have one. Additionally, the slide lists the skills that the bot can retrieve, which are related to mining, crafting, cooking, and combat.
