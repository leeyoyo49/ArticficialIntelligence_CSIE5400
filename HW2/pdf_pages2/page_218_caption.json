<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Multimodal Reasoning" and discusses how Multimodal Language Models (MLLMs) can understand text-to-image references. The Image Declaration is proposed as a solution to establish the reference between image and text. The slide is divided into four sections: Original Visual Question Answering, Image Declaration, Multi-modal Data with Interconnected Images, and Unified Multi-modal-in-context Format. Each section provides an example of how MLLMs can analyze images to answer questions, generate descriptions, and establish connections between images. The source of the information is cited as "MMICL: Empowering Vision-language Model with Multi-Modal In-Context Learning," ICLR, 2024.

Keywords: Multimodality, Reasoning, Language Models, Text, Image, Declaration, Reference, Solution, Example, Analysis, Description, Connection, Source, Citation.

There is no plot or formula on the slide to describe.
