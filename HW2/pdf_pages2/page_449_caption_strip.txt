The slide is titled "BERTScore Architecture" and discusses the architecture of BERTScore, a metric used to evaluate the quality of text generated by models like BERT, RoBERTa, XLNET, and XLM. The slide is divided into three main sections: Contextual Embeddings, Pairwise Cosine Similarity, and Maximum Similarity with optional Importance Weighting.

In the first section, Contextual embeddings are explained as representations of reference and candidate sentences based on surrounding words. These embeddings are computed by the aforementioned models.

The second section illustrates the process of calculating pairwise cosine similarity between the embeddings of the words in the sentences. This is represented by a matrix where each cell contains the cosine similarity score between two words.

The third section shows the calculation of maximum similarity, which is the sum of the highest similarity scores in each row of the matrix. An optional step of importance weighting is also mentioned, which adjusts the maximum similarity score based on the importance of each word.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, it does provide an example of how to calculate the BERT score for a given sentence using the mentioned methods.
