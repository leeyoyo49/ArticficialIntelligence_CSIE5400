1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT)" and discusses the concept of adding a "reasoning process" before providing an answer. The slide contains three examples of questions and their corresponding answers, demonstrating the reasoning process. The questions are "Elon Musk", "Bill Gates", and "Barack Obama". The answers are derived by concatenating the last letters of the words in the questions, resulting in "nk" for Elon Musk, "Is" for Bill Gates, and "ka" for Barack Obama. The reasoning process is highlighted in red in the slide. The source of the content is "Large Language Model Agents," CS294/194-196, Berkeley University, 2024.

The slide does not contain any plots or formulas, so there is no description of a plot or a formula to provide. The keywords that can be extracted from this slide are: Few-shot, CoT, reasoning process, answer, accuracy, demonstration examples, and source.

The summary of the slide is as follows: The slide introduces the concept called "few-shot CoT", which involves adding a reasoning process before answering a question. This process is demonstrated through three examples, where the answers are obtained by concatenation of the last letter of each word in the question. The accuracy of this method is claimed to be 100% with the provided demonstration examples. The content is sourced from a course at Berkeley University.
