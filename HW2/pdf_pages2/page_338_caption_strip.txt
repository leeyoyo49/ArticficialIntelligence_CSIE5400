The slide is titled "Time-Limited Values" and discusses the concept of time-limited values in the context of game theory. The key idea is to define V_k(s) as the optimal value of s if the game ends in k more time steps. This is equivalent to what a depth-k expectimax would give from s. The slide includes a diagram of a decision tree with nodes representing different states and arrows indicating possible moves. There is also a triangle labeled V_2(s) representing the value of a specific state s after 2 time steps.

The summary of the slide is as follows: The concept of "Time Limited Values" in game theory is introduced, with a focus on the optimal values of a game state after a certain number of time steps, specifically k. This concept is related to the depth of an expectimax tree, which is a decision-making algorithm used in artificial intelligence. The decision tree diagram illustrates the possible states and moves in a game, while the triangle represents a specific state's value after a given time step. The keywords associated with this slide are: Time Limited Values, Optimal Value, Game Theory, Depth, Expectimax Tree, Decision Tree, States, Moves, and Time Steps.

The formula presented on the slide can be saved in LaTex format as follows:
\[
V_{k}(s) = \text{optimal value of } s \text { if the end of the game occurs in } k\text { more steps}
\]
This formula defines the value V_k of a state s, given that the game will end after k more steps.
