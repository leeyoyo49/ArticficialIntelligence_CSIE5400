The slide is titled "A Case Study" and discusses the task of Language Model Self-Improvement (LMSI). The task is to improve language models without requiring external supervision, in an unsupervised training manner. The slide mentions two notable LMSI works: RLCAI (arXiv 2022) and RLAIF (arXi 2023).

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, it does provide a detailed explanation of the RLC AI work, which employs a model to evaluate which of the two answers better adheres to a set of rules or principles, subsequently creating a dataset of AI preferences. The system then trains using reinforcement learning, with the preference model as the reward signal.
