1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Evaluation Metrics for Text Summarization" and discusses three different metrics used to evaluate text summarization: BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore. 

BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a method for automatic evaluation of machine translation. ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is another method for evaluating automatic summarization. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) Score is used for measuring semantic similarity.

The slide also provides three references for further reading on these topics. 

The keywords associated with this slide are: Evaluation, Metrics, Text Summary, Machine Translation, Automatic Evaluation, Semantic Similarity.

There is no plot or formula presented on this slide.
