1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "The system prompt for automatic curriculum (1/3)" and is part of a larger presentation on Artificial Intelligence. The content of the slide is primarily textual, with no images, charts, tables, or diagrams. The text is organized into bullet points, with each bullet point representing a different piece of information or instruction. The slide does not contain any formulas or plots.

The slide provides a system prompt that is designed to guide a helpful assistant in the game of Minecraft. The prompt includes a list of questions and answers that represent additional context for the assistant. The questions cover various aspects of the game, such as the player's health, hunger, position, equipment, inventory, chests, completed tasks, and failed tasks. The assistant is instructed to deposit or take items from the chests and to equip itself with better armor if it has it in its inventory.

The keywords that can be extracted from this slide include "system prompt," "automatic curriculum," "Minecraft," "health," "hunger," "position," "equipment," "inventory," "chests," "completed tasks," and "failed tasks." These keywords are relevant to the topic of Artificial Intelligence and the specific application of AI in the context of a game like Minecraft.

The formula mentioned in the slide, "(The list of question-answer pairs represents the additional context.)", is not a mathematical formula but rather a descriptive statement about the purpose of the list. It indicates that the question-answer pairings are meant to provide the assistant with the necessary context to perform its tasks effectively.
