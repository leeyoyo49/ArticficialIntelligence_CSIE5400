The slide is titled "Feature-Based Representations" and discusses the concept of describing a state using a vector of features or properties. The features are functions from states to real numbers, often binary (0/1), that capture important properties of the state. Examples of features include the distance to the closest ghost or dot, the number of ghosts, and whether Pacman is in a tunnel. The slide also mentions that a state can be described as a q-state (s, a) with features, such as action moves closer to food. The image on the right side of the slide appears to be a visual representation of a maze game, possibly related to the Pacman game mentioned in the text. However, there is no plot or formula on the slide to describe.
