| -0.57 | 57   |

The slide also includes a note at the bottom stating "Values after 100 iterations". 

The slide does not contain any formulas or definitions, but it does show a plot of the gridworld with the V* values. 

The keywords that can be extracted from this slide are: Gridworld, V*, Values, Iterations, Positive, Negative, 100, 1, 57, 64, 28, 43, 48, 49, 74, 85.
