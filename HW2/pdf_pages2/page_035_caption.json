1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "The Transformer Decoder Block (4)" and is the 35th slide in the presentation. The main content of the slide is a diagram of a transformer decoder block, which is a part of the transformer model used in natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The diagram is divided into two main sections: the Transformer decoder and the Multi-head attention block.

The Transformer decoder section of the diagram shows a series of layers, each consisting of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism and a Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN). The Multi-Hat Attention mechanism is further divided into three parts: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V), which are used to calculate the attention scores. The FFN consists of two fully connected layers with a ReLU activation function in between. The output of the FFN is then added to the original input through a residual connection.

The Multi-head Attention block is a key component of the Transformer model. It is not self-attention, meaning it does not attend over encoder outputs. Instead, it attends over the outputs of the encoder. For image captions, this is how we inject image features into the decoder.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, it does contain a diagram that visually represents the structure and components of a Transformer decoder block.
