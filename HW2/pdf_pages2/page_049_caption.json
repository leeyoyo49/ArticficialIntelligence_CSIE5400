<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Multimodal Embedding Spaces" and discusses the concept of multimodal embedding spaces in the context of artificial intelligence. It explains that these spaces are typically learned by collecting large amounts of paired multimodal data from the internet, often images and text, and learning encoders for each modality using a pairwise similarity objective. The slide also mentions a dataset called LAION-5B, which is a new era of open large-scale multimodal datasets, consisting of 5.85 billion CLIP-filtered image-text pairs, 14 times bigger than LAION 400M, previously the biggest openly accessible image-text dataset in the world. The authors of this dataset are Christoph Schumann, Richard Vencu, Romain Beaumont, Theo Coombes, Carla Gordon, Aarush Katta, Robert Kaczmarzyk, and Jeni Jitsev. The images on the slide show a young boy playing basketball and two dogs playing in the grass, which are likely examples of the type of data used in this dataset.
