<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Probing 'Visible' Physical Commonsense Knowledge" and discusses visually accessible knowledge representing color, size, and space. It presents a table with zero-shot results (R-Acc) across all tasks for different models: BERT_large, RoBERTa_large, UnifiedQA_large, VisualBERT, and Human. The table shows the R-Acc for each model in three categories: Color, Size, and Spatial. The highest R-Ac for humans is 97.45 in the Color category, followed by 90.12 in the Size category, and 88.24 in the Spatial category. The slide also includes a formula for calculating Relaxed Accuracy (R-Ac), which is the prediction (Pi) is accurate if the most probable label (li) belongs to the set of ground-truth labels (Ti). The formula is: R_A = Σ [li ∈ Ti] ∧ [li = arg max_i P_i(l)] / |D|. The source of the information is "VIPHY: Probing "Visible" PhysicalCommonsense Knowledge," EMNLP 2023.

Summary:
The slide presents a study on probing 'visible' physical commonsense knowledge using different AI models. The study compares the performance of AI models and humans in tasks related to visual accessibility, focusing on color recognition, size estimation, and spatial understanding. The results show that humans outperform AI models in all three categories, with the highest accuracy being in color recognition. The formula provided calculates the relaxed accuracy, which is a measure of the model's ability to predict the correct label based on the highest probability.
