3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Analogical Reasoning: An Example" and discusses a mathematical problem related to finding the area of a square with given vertices. The problem is broken down into steps, starting with recalling a related problem of finding the distance between two points on a coordinate plane. The distance formula is introduced and applied to the given points, resulting in the length of each side of the square being found to be the square root of 32. This length is then squared to find the area, which is calculated to be 32.

The slide does not contain any plots or formulas that need to be described or saved. However, the distance formula used in the problem is d = √((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^^2), which is a standard formula for calculating the Euclidean distance between a point (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in a 2D coordinate system.

The keywords that can be extracted from this slide are: Analogical reasoning, Mathematical problem, Coordinate plane, Distance formula, Square, Area, Points, Vertices, Length, and Square root.

The summary of the slide is as follows: The slide presents an example of analogical reasoning in mathematics, specifically in the context of solving a geometric problem. It demonstrates how a related mathematical problem can be used to solve a more complex problem. The slide uses a step-by-step approach to solve the problem, applying a distance formula and then using the result to calculate the square's area.
