1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Masked Self-Attention Layer" and discusses the architecture of the Vision Transformer (ViT). It explains that masked self-attention is used to ensure that the model doesn't attend to some of the tokens in the input sequence during training or generation. The slide also includes a diagram of the ViT architecture, showing the flow of data through various components such as Add & Norm, Feed Forward, Multi-Head Attention, and Positional Encoding. The diagram is color-coded to differentiate between the different components. The source of the information is cited as "Attention is AI You Need," NIPS. 2017. The keywords that are most relevant to the content of the slide are: Vision Transformer, Masked Attention, Self-Attention, Model, Tokens, Input Sequence, Training, Generation, Diagram, Architecture, Flow of Data, Components, Color-Coded, Source, Citation.
