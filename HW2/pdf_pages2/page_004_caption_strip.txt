The slide is titled "AI Weekly" and discusses the "Basic principle of deep reinforcement learning". The main content of the slide is a diagram illustrating the components and process of a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) system. The diagram is divided into two main parts: the Agent and the Environment. The Agent is represented by a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and is connected to the Environment through a series of states and actions. The DNN is depicted as a complex network of nodes and connections, symbolizing the processing and decision-making capabilities of the agent. The Environment is shown as a simpler network, indicating the external factors that the agent interacts with. The process of DRL involves the agent receiving a state from the environment, processing it through the DNN to determine an action, and then receiving a reward based on the action's outcome. This cycle of state, action, reward, and state is repeated, with the goal of maximizing the cumulative reward over time. The slide does not contain any formulas or specific examples, but it does provide a high-level overview of the DRL process. The keywords that can be extracted from this slide are: AI, Weekly, Basic principle, Deep reinforcement learning, Agent, Environment, Deep Neural network, State, Action, Reward, and Cumulative reward. There is no plot shown on the slide.
