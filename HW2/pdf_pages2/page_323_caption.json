1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Infinite Utilities?" and discusses the problem of infinite rewards in a game that lasts forever. It proposes three solutions to this problem: finite horizon, discounting, and absorbing state. The finite horizon solution is similar to depth-limited search and involves terminating episodes after a fixed number of steps. The discounting solution involves using a discount factor (γ) between 0 and 1 to give nonstationary policies. The absorbing state solution guarantees that for every policy, a terminal state will eventually be reached, similar to the concept of "overheated" in racing. The slide also includes a mathematical formula for the utility function, which is the sum of γ^t * r_t from t=0 to infinity, where r_t is the reward at time t, γ is the discount factor, and R_max/(1-γ) is the maximum possible reward. The plot on the slide appears to be a stylized representation of a snake eating an apple, which may be a metaphor for the concept being discussed.
