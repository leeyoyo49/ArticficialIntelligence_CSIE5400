The slide is titled "k=100" and presents a grid of values after 100 iterations. The grid is divided into 9 squares, each containing a numerical value. The values range from -1.00 to 1.0, with the highest value located in the top right square and the lowest value in the bottom right square. The slide also provides additional information about the noise, discount, and living reward, which are all set to 0.2, 0, and 0 respectively. The formula presented on the slide is k=100, which seems to be a constant or parameter used in the context of the grid values. However, without further context, it's difficult to provide a detailed explanation of the formula. The keywords that stand out from this slide are "grid", "values", "iterations", "noise", "discount", and "living reward".
