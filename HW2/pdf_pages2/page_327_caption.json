1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Example – Gridworld V* Values" and contains a 4x4 grid with numerical values in each cell. The grid is color-coded with green for positive values and red for negative values. The values in the grid are as follows:

|   |   |
|---|---|
| 0.64 | -1.00 |
| 1.0  |  57  |
| -0.57 | 57   |

The slide also includes a note at the bottom stating "Values after 100 iterations". 

The slide does not contain any formulas or definitions, but it does show a plot of the gridworld with the V* values. 

The keywords that can be extracted from this slide are: Gridworld, V*, Values, Iterations, Positive, Negative, 100, 1, 57, 64, 28, 43, 48, 49, 74, 85.

The plot in the slide is a grid with 4 rows and 4 columns, each cell containing a numerical value. The cells with positive values are colored green, while the cell with a negative value is colored red.
