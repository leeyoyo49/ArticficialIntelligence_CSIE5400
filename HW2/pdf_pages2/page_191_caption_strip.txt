The slide is titled "Key Idea: Derive the Final Answer through Intermediate Steps" and discusses a pioneering study that utilized natural language rationales to solve math problems by deriving the final answer through a series of small steps. The study proposed a model to jointly learn to generate the text in the rationale and to perform the math operations required to solve the problem.

The slide presents a math problem: "Two trains running in opposite directions cross a man standing on the platform in 27 seconds and 17 seconds respectively and they cross each other in 23 seconds. The ratio of their speeds is: Options: A) 3/7 B) 5/2 C) 7/8 D) 8/3 E) 2/2". The solution to the problem is provided, with the correct answer being option B, which is the ratio of the speeds of the two trains being 5:2. The rationale for the solution is explained step by step, using algebraic equations to represent the lengths of the trains and the time it takes for them to pass each other.
