2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Computing Actions from Values" and discusses the concept of policy extraction in the context of artificial intelligence. The main content of the slide is divided into three bullet points. The first bullet point introduces the idea of having optimal values, denoted as V*(s), and poses the question of how to act based on these values. The second bullet point acknowledges that the action is not obvious and suggests the need for a mini-expectimax, which is a one-step approach. The third bullet point explains that this approach is called policy extraction, as it derives the policy implied by the values.

The slide also includes a visual representation of a grid with numerical values ranging from 0.80 to 1.00. The grid is color-coded, with green cells indicating positive values and a red cell indicating a negative value. There is also a formula presented on the slide, which appears to be a mathematical representation of the policy extraction process. The formula is as follows:

π*(s) = arg max_a Σ T(s, a, s') [R(s,a,s') + γV*(s')]

This formula is used to compute the optimal action (a) for a given state (s) by maximizing the expected return. The expected return is calculated as the sum of the product of the transition probability (T) and the reward (R), plus the discounted optimal value of the next state (V)*(s'). The discount factor (γ) is also included in the formula.

In summary, the slide provides an overview of the process of computing actions based on optimal values in artificial intelligence through policy extraction. It introduces the concept, acknowledges the complexity of the decision-making process, and presents a mathematical formula to guide the computation of actions.
