The slide is titled "Sample Skill Library" and discusses the process of adding a new skill to the library. The main content is divided into three sections: "Program Generated by GPT-4", "Task: Craft Iron Pickaxe", and "Skill Retrieval". 

In the first section, there is a code snippet written in a programming language, possibly Python, that describes a function named "combatZombie". This function is about equipping a stone sword to combat a zombie, crafting a shield for added protection, and then cooking sticks to restore hunger. Once hunger is replenished, the bot actively searches for a zombie and engages in combat with it.

The second section presents a task to craft an iron pickaxe in Minecraft. The process involves three iron ingots and two sticks. Once the materials are gathered, the skill is added to the skill library.

The third section is about skill retrieval. It shows a flowchart that starts with an embedding process, followed by a query, and ends with the retrieval of the top-5 relevant skills. These skills include smelting iron ingot, crafting stick, making crafting table, making furnace, and crafting wooden pickaxe.

The slide does not contain any plots or formulas. However, the flowchart in the third section can be described as a process of retrieving relevant skills based on an embedding query.
