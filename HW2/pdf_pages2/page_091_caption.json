<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "A Running Example (3/4)" and is divided into three main sections: "Automatic Curriculum," "Iterative Prompting Mechanism," and "Skill Library." The Automatic Curriculum section shows a flowchart with four steps: "Mine Wood Log," "Combat Zombie," "Make Crafting Table," and a new task that is not fully visible in the image. Each step is represented by an image from the game Minecraft, indicating the actions to be taken in the game.

The Iterative Promising Mechanism section contains a code snippet written in JavaScript. The code defines an asynchronous function named "combatZombie" that takes a parameter "bot." The function checks if the "bot" has a "sword" in its inventory. If it does, the bot equips the sword. If not, the function waits for the bot to craft a "stone_sword" and then equips it. There are ellipses indicating that there are additional steps in the function that are not shown.

The Skill Library section lists five skills that can be retrieved by the bot: "Stone Sword," "Craft Shield," "Cook Steak," "Fight Zombie," and one skill that is partially occluded but can be inferred as "Mine Diamond" based on the context.

The slide also includes a visual representation of the environment in which the bot operates, depicted as a screenshot of the Minecraft game interface. The slide number is 91, indicating that this is the 91st slide in the presentation.

In summary, the slide provides an example of how a bot can use an automatic curriculum and an iterative prompting mechanism to perform tasks in a game environment. The bot can mine wood, combat zombies, and craft items, and it can retrieve these skills from a skill library.
