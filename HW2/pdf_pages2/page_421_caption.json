1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Feature-Based Representations" and discusses the concept of describing a state using a vector of features or properties. The features are functions from states to real numbers, often binary (0/1), that capture important properties of the state. Examples of features include the distance to the closest ghost or dot, the number of ghosts, and whether Pacman is in a tunnel. The slide also mentions that a state can be described as a q-state (s, a) with features, such as action moves closer to food. The image on the right side of the slide appears to be a visual representation of a maze game, possibly related to the Pacman game mentioned in the text. However, there is no plot or formula on the slide to describe.
