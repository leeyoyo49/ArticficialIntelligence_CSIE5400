<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Multimodal CoT Reasoning" and discusses how multimodality contributes to effective rationales in artificial intelligence. The slide includes a line graph and a bar chart.

The line graph shows the accuracy of different models over 10 epochs. The models are "One-stage Baseline", "One-Stage Multimodal", "Two-Stage Baseline" and "Two Stage Multimodality". The accuracy of all models increases over the epochs, with the "Two-stage Multimodel" having the highest accuracy.

The bar chart compares the accuracy with and without vision modality for two datasets, "base (200M)" and "large (700M)". The "with Vision Modality" model has higher accuracy for both datasets.

The slide does not contain any formulas or definitions.

The keywords are: Multimode, CoT, Reasoning, Artificial Intelligence, Accuracy, Epochs, Models, Baseline, Two-Stage, One-Stage.

There is no plot described in the slide.
