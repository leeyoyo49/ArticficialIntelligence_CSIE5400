It explains the concept of positional encoding in the context of self-attention in artificial intelligence. The slide is divided into two main sections: a diagram on the left and a text explanation on the right.

The diagram illustrates the process of applying positional encoding to input vectors. It shows three input vectors (x0, x1, x2) and their corresponding position encodings (p0, p1, p2). The position encoding is represented as a d-dimensional vector, where d is the dimensionality of the input vectors.

The text explanation provides two options for implementing positional encoding: learning a lookup table and designing a fixed function with the desiderata. The lookup table option involves learning parameters to use for pos(t) for t in the range [0, T], where T is the length of the sequence. The fixed function option involves designing a function with specific properties.

The slide also includes a mathematical formula for the positional encoding function, which is a sum of sine and cosine functions of different frequencies. The formula is as follows:

p(t) = [sin(ω1.t), cos(ω2.t), sin(ω3.t), ...]

where ωk = 1 / (10000^2k/d), and k is the index of the term in the sum.

The keywords related to this slide are: Positional Encoding, Self-Attention, Lookup Table, Fixed Function, Desiderata, Sine, Cosine, Frequency, Input Vectors, Position Encodings, and Mathematical Formula.

The plot in the slide is a diagram that visually represents the application of positional encodings to input sequences. It uses boxes and arrows to show the transformation of input vectors into positionally encoded vectors.
