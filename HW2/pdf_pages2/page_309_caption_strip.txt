The slide is titled "Example: Racing" and discusses a scenario where an autonomous car (robot car) aims to travel far and quickly. The car can be in one of three states: Cool, Warm, or Overheated. There are two possible actions the car can take: Slow or Fast. The reward for the car is doubled when it goes faster. The slide also includes a diagram showing the transitions between the states and actions, with numerical values indicating the reward or penalty for each transition. The diagram uses arrows to show the direction of the transition and the color of the arrow to indicate the action taken (blue for Slow, red for Fast). The states are represented by images of cars, with the Cool car being blue, the Warm car being pink, and the Overheated car being gray. The numerical values next to the arrows indicate the reward for that transition. For example, the transition from Cool to Warm with a Fast action has a reward of +2. The formula for the reward is not explicitly given on the slide, but it can be inferred from the diagram and the text.
