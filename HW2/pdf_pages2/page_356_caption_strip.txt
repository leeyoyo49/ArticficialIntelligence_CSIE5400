The slide is titled "k=6" and is part of a presentation on Artificial Intelligence. The main content of the slide is a 4x4 grid with each cell containing a numerical value. The grid is color-coded, with green cells indicating positive values and a red cell indicating a negative value of -1.00. The values in the grid are as follows: 

- Top left: 0.59
- Top middle: 1.0
- Bottom left: -1,00 (red)
- Bottom middle: -0.19
- Middle right: 2.00
- Right middle (red): -1

The slide also contains three pieces of information in the bottom right corner: "Noise =0.2", "Discount=0.9", and "Living reward =0". These seem to be parameters or settings related to the grid or the process that generated it.

The slide does not contain any formulas or definitions, but it does show a plot of the grid with the values after 6 iterations. The plot seems to be a visual representation of a grid-based algorithm or model, possibly related to reinforcement learning or a similar concept in AI.

The most relevant keyword from this slide would be "Artificial Intelligence", as it is the topic of the presentation. Other relevant keywords could be "grid", "algorithm", "reinforcement learning", "parameters", "noise", "discount", "living reward", "iterations", "values", "positive", "negative", "red", "green", "black", "white", "gridworld display".

The formula that can be extracted from the grid is not explicitly given in the slide, but the grid itself can be represented as a matrix. The matrix would look something like this:

```
[[0.5, 1, 0, -1],
 [0.4, 2, 3, 4],
 [-0.1, -2, -3, -4],
 [5, -6, -7, -8]]
```
