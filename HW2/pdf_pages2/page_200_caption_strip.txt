The slide is titled "Overview of Different Reasoning Methods" and discusses three types of reasoning methods used in artificial intelligence: Generic guidance reasoning, Few-shot CoT, and Analogical Prompting. Each method is explained with an example.

1. **Generic Guidance Reasoning**: This method requires labeled exemplars of reasoning. An example is given where the question is to find the area of a square with given vertices. The model input is the question, and the model output is the answer, which is calculated by squaring the length of the side of the square.

2. **Few-shot Chain of Thought (CoT)**: In this method, exemplars are automatically generated and tailored to each problem. The example given is similar to the first method, but the model input includes a step-by-step explanation of how to solve the problem.

3. **Analogical Reasoning (Prompting)**: The model is prompted to recall relevant exemplars and solve the initial problem. In the example given, the model is asked to solve a geometry problem, and it recalls the method of finding the side length by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in the x and y coordinates of the vertices.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, the formula used in the model's output for the geometry problem is \(\sqrt{(2 - (-2))^2 + (-2 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{32} = 5\), which is then squared to get the area \(5^2 = 25\).
