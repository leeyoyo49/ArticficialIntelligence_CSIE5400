The slide is titled "Optimal Policies" and is divided into four sections, each containing a 3x3 grid. Each grid represents a state in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with four possible actions: up, down, left, and right. The state is represented by a blue square in the center of the grid, and the actions are represented by blue arrows pointing in the direction of the action. The rewards for each action are indicated by the numbers "+1" or "-1" next to the arrows.

The slide does not contain any written content such as bullet points or definitions, nor does it contain any formulas or inline examples. There is no plot shown on the slide.

The summary of the slide is as follows: The slide presents a visual representation of optimal policies in an MDP, with each grid showing a state and the possible actions and their corresponding rewards. The optimal policy is determined by the action that maximizes the reward in each state.

The keywords from this slide are: Optimal Policies, Markov, Decision Process, State, Actions, Rewards, Grid, Blue Square, Blue Arrows, Up, Down, Left, Right, +1, -1.

The formula present in the image is: R(s) = -0.01, R (s)=-0.03, R(s)=-0.4, R(S)=-2.0. This formula represents the reward for each state in the MDP. The reward is a numerical value that indicates the desirability of taking a particular action in a given state. A higher reward indicates a more desirable action, while a lower reward indicates an undesirable action.
