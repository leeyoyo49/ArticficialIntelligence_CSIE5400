The slide is titled "Discounting" and discusses the concept of discounting in the context of artificial intelligence. The slide is divided into three main sections: "How to discount?", "Why discount?", and "Example: discount of 0.5". 

In the first section, it explains that each time we descend a level, we multiply in the discount once. The second section provides reasons for discounting, stating that sooner rewards probably do have higher utility than later rewards and that discounting also helps our algorithms converge. 

The third section provides an example of a discount rate of 50%. It presents two utility calculations: U([1,2,3]) = 1*1 + 0,5*2 + 1,25*3 = 2.75 and U([3,2.1]) =1*3 + 2*2+ 1.25*1 = 5.25. It concludes with the statement that the first utility calculation is less than the second one.

On the right side of the slide, there is a diagram illustrating a decision tree with nodes and paths. The nodes are represented by different shapes and colors, and the paths are indicated by arrows. The diagram seems to be a visual representation of the decision-making process in AI, possibly related to the discounting concept discussed in the text.

The keywords from this slide could be: Discounting, Utility, Decision Tree, AI, Algorithms, Rewards, Convergence.

The formula presented in the slide is: U(x) = x1 + γ*x2 + γ^2*x3, where γ is the discount rate. This formula is used to calculate the utility of a sequence of rewards, taking into account the time value of money or the preference for immediate rewards over delayed ones.
