1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "BERTScore Architecture" and discusses the architecture of BERTScore, a metric used to evaluate the quality of text generated by a model. The slide is divided into three main sections: Contextual Embedding, Pairwise Cosine Similarity, and Maximum Similarity. 

In the first section, the slide explains the process of contextual embedding, where a reference text and a candidate text are converted into numerical vectors. The reference text is "the weather is cold today" and the candidate text "it is freezing today". 

The second section discusses pairwise cosine similarity, where the cosine of the angle between the two vectors is calculated to measure the similarity between the reference and candidate texts. 

The third section introduces the concept of importance weighting, which considers the importance of rare words using Inverse Document Frequency (IDF). The slide provides a formula for calculating the BERT score, which is a weighted sum of the maximum similarities between the candidate and reference texts.

The slide does not contain any plots or formulas, but it does provide an example of how the importance weighting is applied in the formula. The formula is: R_BERT = (0.713×1.27)+(0.515×7.94)+... / (1×2.27+7×94+1.82+7.90+8.88). 

The keywords from this slide are: BERT, BERTscore, Architecture, Contextual embedding, Cosine similarity, Maximum similarity, Importance weighting, Inverse document frequency, and formula.
