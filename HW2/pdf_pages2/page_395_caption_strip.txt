The slide is titled "Direct Evaluation" and discusses a method for computing values for each state under a certain policy, denoted by the Greek letter π (pi). The idea is to average together observed sample values. The process involves acting according to the policy, recording the sum of discounted rewards at each state until the end of an episode, and then averaging these samples. This method is referred to as direct or Monte-Carlo evaluation. The slide also includes a visual representation of a slot machine, symbolizing the concept of states and rewards in the context of a game or decision-making scenario. The formula presented on the slide is:

samplei(s) = R(s) + γR(s') + γ^2R(s'') + ...

This formula represents the expected reward-to-go for a state s, where R(s), R(s'), R(s''), etc., are the rewards at different states, and γ is a discount factor. The average of these samples is given by:

V(s) ≈ 1/N Σ samplei(s)

Here, N is the number of samples, and i is the index of the sample. This formula is used to estimate the value of a state under the policy π.
