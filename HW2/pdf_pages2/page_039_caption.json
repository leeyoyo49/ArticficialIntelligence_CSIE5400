1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Text to Image Generation with Diffusion Based Models" and discusses the diffusion process. It explains that if we observe the movement of a single molecule on a very short time scale, it follows a Gaussian distribution. The slide also mentions that since the direction of mixing and the opposite direction are the same in a short time, the opposite distribution also follows a Gaussain distribution. There is a diagram on the slide that shows a molecule moving from one point to another. The diagram is labeled with "m1", "m2", and "m3" to represent different points in the molecule's movement. The source of the information is provided at the bottom of the slide.
