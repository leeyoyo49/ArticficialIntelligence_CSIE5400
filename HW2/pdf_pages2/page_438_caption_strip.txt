The slide is titled "Sample Task: Reasoning about Colored Objects (3/3)" and is the 153rd slide in a series. The main content of the slide is a question type, specifically question type 5, which asks "How many objects of a type remain when some objects are removed?" An example is provided to illustrate this question type. The example involves a nightstand with various objects, including mugs and jugs of different colors. The question asks how many brown objects would remain on the nightstand if all the jugs were removed.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots, and there are no keywords that stand out as particularly relevant to the content. The slide is simple and straightforward, with a focus on the question type and its example.

Here is the formula for the example given in the slide:

Let B be the number of brown objects on the table.
Let J be the total number of jugs.
Let M be the brown mugs.
Let G be the gold mugs.

The question asks for the value of B after removing all J jugs.

The answer to the question would be B - M, as all the brown objects are mugs and none of them are jugs.
