The slide is titled "Positional Encoding" and discusses the concept of positional encoding in the context of self-attention in artificial intelligence. The main content of the slide explains that positional encoding is used to concatenate a special positional encoding pj to each input vector xj. This is done to process the position j of the vector into a d-dimensional vector using a function pos: N -> Rd. The slide also includes a diagram that visually represents the process, with input vectors x0, x1, x2, and their corresponding positional encodings p0, p1, p2. The diagram shows the flow from input vectors to positional encoders, and then to self-attentions. The source of the information is cited as "Attention is all you need," from NeurIPS, 2017.

Summary:
The slide provides an overview of the positional encoding technique used in self-attentive neural networks. It explains how positional encoding helps to incorporate the position information of input vectors into the model, which is crucial for tasks that require understanding the sequence or order of data, such as natural language processing. The visual diagram illustrates the process of applying positional encoding to input vectors before they are processed by self-atention mechanisms.

Plot Description:
The diagram on the slide represents the flow of data through a neural network layer. It starts with three input vectors (x0 to x2), each associated with a corresponding positional encoding (p0 to p2). These vectors and encodings are then processed by a self-attension mechanism, which likely involves some form of attention calculation to weigh the importance of different parts of the input.

LaTeX Formula:
The formula mentioned in the slide is:
\[ p_j = pos(j) \]
This formula represents the function pos that maps a position j to its corresponding d-dimensional positional encoding p_j.
