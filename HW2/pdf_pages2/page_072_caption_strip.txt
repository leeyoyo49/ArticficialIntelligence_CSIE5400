The slide is titled "Tool Use: Example" and discusses the concept of "Tool Augmented Language Models." It explains that these models take an input, use a tool to process it, and then produce an output. The process is illustrated with a diagram showing the flow from input to tool input, tool result, and finally to output.

The slide also provides an example of an abstract task and a weather task. In the abstract task, the input text is "tool-call tool input text" and the output is "output task output text." In the weather task, a user asks "how hot will it get in NYC today?" and the tool input is "weather lookup region=NYC |result precipitation chance: 10, high temp: 20c, low-temp: 12c |output todayâ€™s high will be 20C."

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, it does mention a source for the information presented: "TALM: Tool Augmenting Language Models," arXiv, 2022.
