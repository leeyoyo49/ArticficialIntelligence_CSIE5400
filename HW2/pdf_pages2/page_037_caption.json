1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Text to Image Generation with Diffusion Based Models" and discusses the concept of generating realistic images from text descriptions. The slide includes three images as examples: a dolphin in an astronaut suit on Saturn, a propaganda poster depicting a cat dressed as French emperor Napoleon holding a piece of cheese, and a teddy bear on a skateboard in Times Square. The source of these images is cited as "Hierarchical Text-Conditional Image Generation With CLIP Latents," arXiv, 2022.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, it does mention the use of diffusion-based models in the process of text-to-image generation. Diffusion-based models are a type of generative model used in machine learning to create new data samples that mimic the distribution of a given dataset. In the context of this slide, these models are used to generate realistic images based on text descriptions.

The keywords that can be extracted from this slide are: Text to Image, Generation, Diffusion, Models, Realistic Images, Text Descriptions, Dolphin, Astronaut Suit, Saturn, Propaganda Poster, Cat, French Emperor, Napoleon, Cheese, Teddy Bear, Skateboard, Times Square, Source, Hierarchical, CLIP, Latents.
