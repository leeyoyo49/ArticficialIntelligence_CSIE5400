The slide is titled "Multimodal Embedding Spaces" and discusses the concept of Multimodal Learning. It explains that the multi-modal nature of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models is powered by two encoder models, a Text encoder and an Image encoder, which are trained to "speak the same language". The slide also includes a diagram illustrating the process of multimodal learning, where text and image data are processed through their respective encoders and then combined in a multimodal embedding space. The diagram shows three examples: a mountain landscape, an astronaut riding a horse, and an intergalactic goldfish, each processed through the text encoder and the image encoder, resulting in a set of numerical values. These values are then plotted in a 2D space, with each example represented by a point. The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. The keywords from this slide are: Multimodality, Embedding, Spaces, Learning, MLP, Text encoder, Image encoder.
