1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Stanford AI Village [UST 2023] Episodic memory of experience". It discusses the concept of a memory stream, which is a large number of observations that are relevant and irrelevant to the agent's current situation. The retrieval process identifies a subset of these observations that should be passed to the language model to condition its response to the situation. An example is provided where the agent, Isabella Rodriguez, is planning a Valentine's Day party at Hobbs Cafe. The slide also includes a table with retrieval scores for different actions Isabella might take, such as ordering decorations, researching ideas for the party, or looking forward to the party. The table lists the retrieval score, recency, importance, and relevance for each action. There is no plot or formula on the slide. The most relevant keyword is "Memory Stream".
