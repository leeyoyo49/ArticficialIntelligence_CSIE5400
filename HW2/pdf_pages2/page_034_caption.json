<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Masked Self-Attention Layer" and discusses the concept of preventing vectors from looking at future vectors and setting future alignment scores to negative infinity. The slide includes a diagram of a masked self-attention layer, which is a component of the Transformer model in artificial intelligence. The diagram shows the flow of data through the layer, with input vectors being transformed into output vectors through a series of operations. The operations include a softmax function and an attention mechanism, which are used to calculate the alignment scores between input vectors. The source of the information is cited as "Attention is AI You Need," NIPS. 2017.
