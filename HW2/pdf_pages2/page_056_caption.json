   - Slide Title: Examples
   - Sub-bullet 1: Short Caption (given by human): A blue willys gasser car
     - Long Caption: A willys ganger car in blue color. It is placed near the car shed on the floor. In the back, there is a man seated in the chair.
   - Example 2: A glass of iced tea

2. Summary:
   The slide provides two examples to illustrate the concept of artificial intelligence. The first example is a blue Willys Ganger car, which is a type of vehicle. The car is in a blue color, placed near a car shed, and a man is seated in a chair in the back. The second example is an iced tea in a glass saucer decorated with mint leaves, placed on a wooden table. These examples are given by humans and are used to demonstrate how artificial intelligence can interpret and understand human descriptions.
