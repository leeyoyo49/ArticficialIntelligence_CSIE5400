1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Text to Image Generation with Diffusion Based Models" and discusses the diffusion process in the context of generating images from text. The diffusion process is likened to viewing a molecule's motion as a Gaussian-distributed noise. This process involves adding a Gaussian-dispersed noise to a pixel, which is represented by the formula: Pixel + Noise = Pixel. The slide does not contain any plots or formulas that need to be described or saved. The keywords related to the content of the slide are: Text, Image Generation, Diffusion, Gaussian, Noise, Molecule, Movement, Pixel, and Source. The source of the information is provided as a URL.
