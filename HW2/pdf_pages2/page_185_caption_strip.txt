The slide is titled "Let's start from a toy problem" and introduces the concept of "Last Letter Concatenation". The rule for this concept is to take the last letter of each word and then concatenate them. This is demonstrated with three examples in a table format. The first example is "Elon Musk" with the output "nk", the second is "Bill Gates" with "Is", and the third is "Barack Obama" with a question mark, indicating that the output is left for the audience to figure out. The slide is sourced from "Large Language Model Agents", CS294/194-196, Berkeley University, 2024.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, it does provide an example of a simple string manipulation task that can be solved using programming or algorithmic thinking. This task is a fundamental concept in computer science and is often used as a starting point for more complex problems in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
