<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Example: RT-2: Vision-Language-Action Models [PLMR 2023]" and discusses the transfer of web knowledge to robotic control. The main content is divided into two sections: "Internet-Scale VQA + Robot Action Data" and "Closed-Loop Robot Control."

In the first section, there are three images with corresponding questions and answers. The first image shows a donkey, with the question "What is happening in the image?" and the answer "A grey donkey walks down the street." The second image is of a cooking scene with a question in French "Que puis-je faire avec ces objets?" and an answer "Faire cuire un gâteau." The third image depicts a robotic arm performing a task, with a task description "Put the strawberry into the correct bowl" and a translation and rotation data "[0.1, -0.2, 0] Δ Rotation = [10°, 25°, -7°]."

The second section shows a flowchart with three steps: "Co-Fine-Tune," "Vision-Language Action Models for Robot Control RT -2," and "Deploy." Below the flowchart, there is a section titled "Closed Loop Robot Control" with three images showing different tasks a robot can perform: "Pick the nearly falling bag," "Pick object that is different," and a third task with an obscured image.

The slide does not contain any formulas, so there is no LaTex format to provide. However, the rotation data in the third image can be described as a set of three values representing the rotation in degrees for the x, y, and z axes.
