The slide is titled "Tool Use" and discusses the use of Machine Learning Models (MLMs) to predict model-specific tokens. It explains that sometimes, invoking 'tool calls' is necessary to accomplish the 'prediction' task. The slide also mentions that special tokens can be exploited to invoke tool calls for search engines, calculators, task-specific models like translation, and APIs.

The slide does not contain any plots or formulas, so there is no plot description or formula to provide. However, there is a formula presented on the slide which is: (w1, w2, ..., wt) -> wt+1. This formula represents the prediction of the next token (wt+1) based on the current sequence of tokens (wt).

The summary of the slide is as follows: The slide discusses the role of tool calls in the prediction task of MLMs. It highlights the use and exploitation of special tokens to invoke these tool calls, which can be used for various tasks such as searching, calculating, translating, and interacting with APIs. The formula presented represents the process of token prediction in MLMs.
