The approach involves maximizing the discrepancy measure to define a robust discrepancy metric, which is parameterized by a neural network. Concurrently, the discrepancy between the synthetic dataset D~ and the real dataset D is minimized by optimizing the synthetic data distribution D~. The formal expression of this optimization problem is given as: min max L(D~, D, f, ψ), where L denotes the discrepancy measurement, f is the feature extractor network, and ψ is the network learning the discrepancy metric. This minimax framework seeks the optimal synthetic dataset distribution that minimizes L while the network ψ maximizes L to establish a robust metric. The slide does not contain any images, plots, or formulas that need to be described or saved. The keywords related to the content of the slide are: Adversarial, Distribution Matching, Minimax Optimization, Discrepancy Measure, Neural Network, Feature Extractor, Synthetic Dataset, Real Dataset, and Robust Metric.
