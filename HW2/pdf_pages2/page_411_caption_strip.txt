The slide is titled "Active Reinforcement Learning" and contains a visual representation of a robot navigating through a hazardous environment with flames. The robot is shown in three different stages of movement, with the flames getting closer in each subsequent stage. The slide also includes a mathematical formula: "Acting according to policy π*(s) = argmax Q(s,a)". This formula represents the decision-making process in reinforcement learning, where the agent (robot) chooses the action (a) that maximizes the expected reward (Q(s,a)) given the current state (s).

The slide does not contain any other written content such as bullet points or definitions, nor does it contain any formulas or inline examples. There is no plot shown on the slide.

The mathematical formula in the slide can be described as follows: The formula represents a policy π* that the agent should follow in a given state s. The policy is determined by choosing the action a that results in the maximum expected reward, which is calculated as the sum of the product of the probability of taking action a in state s and the reward received after taking that action. The argmax function is used to select the action that yields the highest expected reward.
