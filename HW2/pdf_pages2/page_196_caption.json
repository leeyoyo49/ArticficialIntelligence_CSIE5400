<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Analogical Prompting" and discusses the goal of adaptively generating relevant examples and knowledge, rather than just using a fixed set of examples. An example of coding (Codeforces task) is provided to illustrate this concept. The source of the information is "Large Language Models as Analogical Reasoners," ICLR, 2024.

Keywords: Analogical Promoting, Goal, adaptively generate, relevant examples, knowledge, coding, Codeforces task.

There is no plot or formula on the slide to describe.
