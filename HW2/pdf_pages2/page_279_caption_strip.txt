The slide is titled "Various reasoning benchmarks are emerging" and is divided into two main sections: "Attribute Reasoning" and "Physical Property Reasoning". 

In the Attribute Reasoning section, there are two questions with multiple-choice answers. The first question asks about the object shown in the figure, which is a diamond. The options are: it's the hardest naturally occurring substance on Earth, it conducts electricity well at room temperature, it's typically found in igneous rocks like salt and granite, and it has a low melting point compared to other minerals. The correct answer is the first option.

The second question in this section is about the function of the demonstrated object, a whisk. The answer choices are: cutting vegetables, stirring, water purification, boiling water, separating, clamping, drilling, and incising. The right answer is stirring.

In the Physical Property Reasonning section, there's a question about a metal object, with the correct answer being that it's attracted to magnets.

The slide also includes images of the objects mentioned in the questions, a diamond, a metal sphere, and a whisk.

There are no formulas or plots on the slide.

The keywords from this slide could be: Artificial Intelligence, Reasoning, Benchmarks, Attribute, Physical Property, Diamond, Metal Sphere, Whisk, Hardest Substance, Conducts Electricity, Igneous Rocks, Melting Point, Low Boiling Point, Attracted to Magnets, Cutting, Stirring, Water Purification, Boiling Water, Separating, Clamping, Drilling, Incising.

The summary of the slide is that it presents various reasoning benchmarks emerging in the field of Artificial Intelligence. It includes examples of attribute reasoning and physical property reasoning, with questions and answers related to a diamond and a diamond sphere, as well as a whisk and its function.
