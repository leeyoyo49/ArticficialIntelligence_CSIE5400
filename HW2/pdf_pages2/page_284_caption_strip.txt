The slide is titled "Various reasoning benchmarks are emerging" and is part of the "HallucinationBench [CVPR 2024]" presentation. The slide is divided into two main sections: "Visual Dependent" and "Visual Supplement". 

In the Visual Dependent section, there are six sub-sections: Illusion, Math, Poster, Figure/Other, Video, and OCR. Each sub-section contains a question related to the content it represents. For example, the Illusion sub-section asks if the right orange circle is the same size as the left orange circle, while the Math sub-section questions if angle 1 + angle 2 is greater than 180 degrees. The Poster sub-section inquires if the image shows "Beijing Roast Duck" or "Guangxi Roast Duck". The Figure/ Other sub-section poses questions about characters from the manga series One Piece or Detective Conan. The Video sub-section discusses whether Homer Simpson disappears into the bushes according to the positive sequence images. Lastly, the OCR sub-section includes a question about the value of the gravity constant 'G' based on the image.

The Visual Supplement section also contains six sub-categories: Table, Chart, No Visual, Map, and No Visual (again). Each sub-category has a question associated with it. For instance, the Table sub-category asks if China has the most gold medals in 2008 Beijing Olympics. The Chart sub-category questions if Tencent was the company with the highest revenue from video games in 2017, with Sony as the second-highest earner. The No Visual sub-category poses a question without any visual content. The Map sub-category inquires about the Democratic Party's win in Texas in the 2020 elections based on a map. Finally, the No Visual section repeats the question from the Map sub-section.

The slide does not contain any plots or formulas, so there is no plot description or formula in Latex format to provide. However, the slide does contain several keywords such as "Illusion", "Math", "Poster", "Figure/Other", "Video", "OCR", "Table", "Chart", "No Visual", "Map", and "2024". These keywords are relevant to the slide's content as they represent the different types of reasoning benchmarks that are emerging in the field of artificial intelligence.
