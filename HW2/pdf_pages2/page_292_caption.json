1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Achieved performances of this paper" and contains four bullet points. The first bullet point states a 20.5% accuracy boost on ImageSquawk [CVPR 2022]. The second bullet point mentions a reduction in GPU memory usage by over 300x. The third bullet point highlights a processing speed that is 20 times faster compared to state-of-the-art methods. The fourth bullet point discusses the first work to achieve lossless compression of CIFAR-100 on a single NVIDIA 2080 Ti GPU using only 2.3 GB of memory.

The slide does not contain any images, plots, or formulas, so there is no additional information to provide in those areas.

The keywords from this slide that are most relevant to the topic of artificial intelligence are: "Accuracy boost", "GPU memory usage reduction", "Processing speeds", "Lossless compression", and "CIFAR-1 00".

The summary of the slide is as follows: The paper discussed in the slide has achieved significant improvements in artificial intelligence applications. It has managed to boost the accuracy of Image Squawk by 20% and has reduced the memory usage of the GPU by more than 300 times. Additionally, the processing speed of the system has increased by a factor of 20 compared to other methods. Lastly, the paper has achieved the first instance of lossless data compression of the CIFAR dataset on a high-performance NVIDIA GPU, using only a small amount of memory.
