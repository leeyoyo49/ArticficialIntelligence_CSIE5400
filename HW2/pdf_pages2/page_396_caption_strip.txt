The slide is titled "Example: Direct Evaluation" and is divided into three main sections: "Input Policy π", "Observed (s, a, s', R) Transitions", and "Output Values". The slide does not contain any formulas or plots, but it does present a table with observed transitions and output values for different episodes.

In the first section, the input policy π is represented by a 3x3 grid with the letters A, B, C, D, and E. The second section shows the observed transitions for four episodes, with each episode detailing the starting state, action taken, resulting state, and reward received. For example, in Episode 1, the action 'east' was taken from state C, resulting in state D and a reward of -1. The third section presents the output values corresponding to the actions taken in each episode. For instance, in the first episode, the output value for action 'B, east' is -10.

The slide also includes a note at the bottom stating "Assume: y = 1".

In summary, the slide provides an example of direct evaluation in the context of reinforcement learning, where an input policy is used to determine actions in different states, and the resulting transitions and rewards are observed and recorded. The output values are then used to evaluate the effectiveness of the policy.
