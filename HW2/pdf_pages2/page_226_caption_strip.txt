The slide is titled "Multimodal CoT Reasoning" and discusses how multimodality contributes to effective rationales in artificial intelligence. The slide includes a line graph and a bar chart.

The line graph shows the accuracy of different models over 10 epochs. The models are "One-stage Baseline", "One-Stage Multimodal", "Two-Stage Baseline" and "Two Stage Multimodality". The accuracy of all models increases over the epochs, with the "Two-stage Multimodel" having the highest accuracy.

The bar chart compares the accuracy with and without vision modality for two datasets, "base (200M)" and "large (700M)". The "with Vision Modality" model has higher accuracy for both datasets.

The slide does not contain any formulas or definitions.

The keywords are: Multimode, CoT, Reasoning, Artificial Intelligence, Accuracy, Epochs, Models, Baseline, Two-Stage, One-Stage.

There is no plot described in the slide.
