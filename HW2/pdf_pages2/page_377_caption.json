1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Comparison" and discusses the differences between value iteration and policy iteration in the context of dynamic programming for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). 

Value iteration updates both the values and the policy implicitly with every iteration, without explicitly tracking the policy. Instead, the maximum over actions is taken implicitly to recompute the policy.

Policy iteration, on the other hand, involves several passes that update utilities with a fixed policy. Each pass is fast because only one action is considered, not all of them. After the policy is evaluated, a new policy is chosen, which is slow like a value iteration pass. The new policy will be better, or the process will be done.

Both methods are dynamic programs for solving MDPs.

The keywords that can be extracted from this slide are: Comparison, Value iteration, Policy iteration, Dynamic programs, MDP, Utilities, Policy, Actions, Iteration, Max, Recompute, Evaluate, New policy, Better.

There is no plot or formula shown on the slide.
