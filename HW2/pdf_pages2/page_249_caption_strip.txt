The slide is titled "Definition of 'Event'". The main content of the slide is a table with two columns. The first column is labeled "Event" and contains the word "Protest". The second column is not labeled and does not contain any text. Below the table, there is a speech bubble with the text "What happened?" and a green upward-pointing triangle next to it. The source of the content is cited as "Knowledge-Driven Vision-Language Encoding," Tutorial, CVPR, 2023.

The image on the slide depicts a protest with people holding signs. The signs have various messages written on them, including "NO CHOICE" and "Parati's NOT Domestic Terrorism". The image is used to visually represent the concept of an event, in this case, a protest.
