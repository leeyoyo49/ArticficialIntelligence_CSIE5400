1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Example – Gridworld Q* Values" and contains a grid with numerical values representing the Q* values in a gridworld environment after 100 iterations. The grid is divided into several sections with different colors: green, gray, and red. The green sections have values ranging from 0.29 to 0,85, the gray section has a value of 0., and the red section has values from -0.65 to -1.00. The slide does not contain any formulas or definitions, but it does show a plot of the gridworld with the mentioned values.

Summary:
The slide provides an example of Q* value distribution in a Gridworld environment. The values are represented in a 10x10 grid, with each cell containing a numerical value. The highest value in the grid is 1.0, located in the top right corner, while the lowest value is -1,00, found in the bottom right corner. The majority of the values are in the green section, indicating a higher Q-value in those areas. The gray and red sections have lower Q-values, suggesting less favorable states in the environment.

Keywords:
- Gridworld
- Q*
- Values
- Iterations
- Numerical values
- Environment
- Favorable states
- Unfavorable states

Plot Description:
The plot is a 2D grid with cells containing numerical values. The cells are color-coded: green for higher values, gray for a neutral value (0.), and red for lower values. This color-coding visually represents the distribution of Q-values across the grid.

LaTeX Formula:
There is no formula present on the slide to convert.
