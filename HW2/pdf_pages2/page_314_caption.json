1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Policies" and discusses the concept of policies in the context of deterministic single-agent search problems and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). It explains that an optimal plan or sequence of actions is desired from the start to a goal. The slide defines an optimal policy as one that maximizes expected utility if followed. It also mentions that an explicit policy defines a reflex agent.

The slide contains the following keywords: Deterministic, Single-agent, Search problems, Optimal plan, Sequence of actions, Start, Goal, MDPs, Optimal policy, S→A, Action, State, Expected utility, Followed, Explicit policy, Reflex agent.

There is no plot or formula on the slide to describe.
