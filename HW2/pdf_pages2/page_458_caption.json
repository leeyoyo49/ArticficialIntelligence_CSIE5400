<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Problem Formulation (3/3)" and discusses the role of the LLM M as a policy mapping from the state space to the probability space over the action space in reinforcement learning. The objective of reinforcement learning is to train the policy to maximize the expected return, which is represented by the formula E[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R(q, o)|q ~ d_0, o_t ~ M(\cdot |s_t)]. The slide also mentions that with the evaluation reward, the LLL M can be updated using any RL algorithm to maximize reward. The most relevant keyword from the text is "Reinforcement Learning". The slide does not contain a plot or a formula that needs to be described in detail.
