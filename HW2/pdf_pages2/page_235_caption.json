1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Visual Commonsense Knowledge" and discusses "VisualCOMET: Cognitive Image Understanding via Visual Commonsense Graphs." The main content of the slide is a visual representation of a scenario involving three individuals in a body of water. The scenario is depicted through a series of interconnected bubbles, each containing a phrase that describes an action or intention of the individuals. The bubbles are color-coded and connected by arrows, indicating the sequence and relationship between the actions. The slide also includes a reference to the source of the content, which is "VisualICOMET: Reasoning About the Dynamic Context of a Still Image," published by ECCV in 2020.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, it does provide a visual example of how VisualCOMET can be used to understand the dynamic context of a still image by interpreting the actions and intentions of individuals based on visual commonsense knowledge. The keywords relevant to the slide include VisualCOMAT, Cognitive Image, Understanding, Visual Commonsence Graphs, Reasoning, Dynamic Context, Still Image, and ECCV.

The formula mentioned in the source reference is not provided in the slide, so it cannot be saved in LaTex format or described.
