The slide is titled "Quiz: Discounting" and contains information about a quiz related to discounting in the context of artificial intelligence. The given information includes a table with the numbers 10 and 1, and a list of actions: East, West, and Exit, which are only available in exit states a and e. The transitions are deterministic. There are three quizzes presented, each asking for the optimal policy for different values of gamma (γ). The first two quizzes ask for γ=1 and γ=0.1, respectively, while the third quiz asks for the value of γ where West and East are equally good when in state d. There is no plot or formula on the slide.

The summary of the slide is as follows: The slide presents a quiz on discounting, which is a concept in artificial intelligence related to decision-making processes. The quiz includes a deterministic transition table and a set of actions that can be taken in certain states. The quizzes challenge the viewer to determine the optimal policies for different discounting factors, γ. The slide does not contain any visual elements such as plots or formulas.

The keywords from this slide are: Quiz, Discounting, Artificial Intelligence, Optimal Policy, Gamma (γ), Deterministic, Transitions, Actions, Exit States, and State d.

Since there is no formula or plot in the slide, there is nothing to save in LaTex format or to describe.
