1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "BLEU (1/4)" and discusses the concept of "Computing unigram precision" in the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It explains how to calculate the percentage of words in a candidate text (C) that are also present in a reference text (R). The formula for this calculation is given as BLEU*(C) = (number of matching words in C and R) / (total words in candidate text C). The slide provides an example where the reference text is "The cat is on the mat" and the candidate text is "'The cat and the dog." In this example, the BLEU score is calculated as 3/5 = 0.6. The slide also highlights a problem with repeating unigrams, using the example "The The The The" which results in a perfect score of 1.0, despite the lack of meaningful content. The keywords from this slide are: BLEU, unigram, precision, reference text, candidate text, matching words, score, problem, repeating unigram. There is no plot or formula on this slide.
