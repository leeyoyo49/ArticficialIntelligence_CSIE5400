<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Challenges: Structure-Aware Encoding" and is divided into two main sections: Text and Vision. The Text section highlights the strong ability in reasoning and semantic structure understanding. The Vision section emphasizes better capturing details with visual features.

The slide also includes a series of images depicting the action "Sitting on a sofa" over time. These images are annotated with labels such as "person", "sofa", "in front of", "beneath", and "next to". These labels are connected by arrows, forming a spatiotemporal scene graph that represents the spatial and temporal relationships between the objects and actions in the images.

There is no formula presented on the slide, so it cannot be saved in LaTex format. However, the scene graph can be described as a directed graph where nodes represent objects or actions, and edges represent the relationships between them. The nodes are color-coded, with pink for people, green for the sofa, and grey for spatial relationships.

The keywords that can be extracted from this slide are: "Challenges", "Structure-Aware", "Encoding", "Text", "Vision", "Reasoning", "Semantic Structure", "Details", "Visual Features", "Action", "Sofa", "Person", "Spatial Relationships", "Temporal Relationships".
