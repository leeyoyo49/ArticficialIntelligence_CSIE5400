The slide is titled "What is Markov about MDPs?" and discusses the concept of Markov decision processes (MDPs) in the context of artificial intelligence. The slide defines "Markov" as a term that generally means that given the present state, the future and the past are independent. It further explains that for Markovian decision processes, the action outcomes depend only on the current state. This is represented by a mathematical formula: P(St+1 = s' | St = st, At = a_t, St-1 = st-1, At-1,..., S0 = s0). The slide also compares this concept to search, where the successor function could only depend on the state (not the history). The keywords from this slide are: Markov, MDP, decision process, action outcomes, current state, search, successor function, state, history.

The slide does not contain a plot or a formula that needs to be described in detail. The image on the slide is a portrait of Andrew Markov (1856-1922), a mathematician known for his work in probability theory.
