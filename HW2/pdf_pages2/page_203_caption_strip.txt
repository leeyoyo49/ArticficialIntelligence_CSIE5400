The slide is titled "A Running Example" and discusses the concept of "Probability for the answer token". It presents a table with six rows, each containing a statement about Nicolas Cage's birth year and its corresponding probability value. The statements are: "Nicolas Cage was born in an odd year", "Even", "Odd", "1964, an even year", and "Cage was born  in 1964. An even year". The probability values range from 0.000 to 1. The source of the information is cited as "Large Language Model Agents", CS294/194-196, Berkeley University, 2024.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, it does provide an example of how probabilities can be assigned to different answer tokens in the context of natural language processing. The probabilities are likely calculated based on the likelihood of each statement being true, given the context and available information.

The keywords from this slide that are most relevant to the topic of artificial intelligence are: Nicolas Cage, birth year, odd year, even year, probability, and large language model agents. These keywords are directly related to the content of the slide and provide a clear understanding of the topic being discussed.
