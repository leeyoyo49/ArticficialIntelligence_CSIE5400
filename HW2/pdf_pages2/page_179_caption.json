<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Probing 'Visible' Physical Commonsense Knowledge" and discusses visually accessible knowledge representing color, size, and space. The content is divided into three sections: Color, Size, and Spatial. Each section provides examples of tasks, settings, and prompts related to the task. For instance, in the Color section, the task is to identify the color of an object, with settings like "ZS" (zero-shot) and "FT" (few-shot), and prompts like "O is of [MASK] color". The Size section involves comparing the size of objects, with similar settings and prompts. The Spatial section deals with the location of objects in space, again with the same types of tasks and settings. The slide also includes images of a computer setup with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, and a robot icon labeled "VLM". The source of the content is cited as "VIPHY: Probing ' Visible' PhysicalCommonsense Knowledge," EMNLP 2023.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, it does provide a comprehensive overview of how artificial intelligence can be used to probe and understand physical commonsense knowledge, particularly in the context of visual perception. This is a crucial aspect of AI research, as it allows machines to interpret and interact with the world in a more human-like manner.

In summary, the slide provides a detailed explanation of how AI can probe 'visible' physical common sense knowledge, with examples and prompts for tasks related to color identification, size comparison, and spatial location. It also includes relevant images and a source citation for further reference.
