1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Infinite Utilities!" and discusses the problem of infinite rewards in a game that lasts forever. The problem is posed as a question: "What if the game lasts forever? Do we get infinite rewards?" The slide then presents a solution to this problem, which is the concept of a finite horizon. This solution is similar to depth-limited search and involves terminating episodes after a fixed number of steps, referred to as 'life'. The slide also mentions that this solution gives nonstationary policies, which depend on the time left in the game.

The slide also includes a visual representation of the problem, depicted as an infinity symbol. This symbol is often used to represent infinite or unending concepts, which aligns with the theme of the slide. The slide does not contain any formulas or plots, so there is no need to save any content in LaTex format or describe a plot.

In summary, the slide presents a problem in the context of artificial intelligence and game theory, and proposes a solution that involves limiting the duration of the game to prevent infinite rewards. The key concepts discussed in the slide are infinite utilities, game duration, rewards, finite horizon, and non-stationary policies. Relevant keywords for this slide could be: Infinite Utilities, Game Duration, Rewards, Finite Horizon, Nonstationary Policies, Depth-Limited Search.
