1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "A Running Example" and discusses the concept of "Chain-of-Thought Decoding" in the context of determining whether Nicolas Cage was born in an even or odd year. The slide includes a table with six rows, each representing a step in the thought process to arrive at the conclusion. The steps are as follows:

1. Nicolas Cage
2. Even
3. Odd
4. 1964
5. He
6. Cage

The final conclusion is that Nicolas Cage, born in the year 1963, is an odd number. The source of the information is cited as "Large Language Model Agents," CS294/194-196, Berkeley University, 2024.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, it does provide an example of how a chain-of-thought process can be used to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, logical steps. The keywords associated with this slide are "Nicolas Cage," "Even," "Odd," "1964," "He," and "Cage."
