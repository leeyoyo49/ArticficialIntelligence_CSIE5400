<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT)" and discusses revisiting the "Last Letter Concatenation" problem using Language Learning Models (LLMs). The slide contains an example of a question and answer pair, where the question is "Elon Musk" and the answer is "nk". Another example is "Bill Gates" with the answer "Is". The third example is a question "Barack Obama" with no answer provided. The slide also includes a diagram of an LLM with an arrow pointing to a red "X" symbol, indicating a failure or error in the process. The source of the information is cited as "Large Language Model Agents," CS294/194-196, Berkeley University, 2024.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots, so there is no need to save any content in LaTex format or describe a plot. The keywords from this slide that are most relevant to the topic of artificial intelligence are: "Artificial Intelligence", "Language Learning Models", "LLMs", "Few-Shot Chain-of-Thought", "CoT", and "Error".
