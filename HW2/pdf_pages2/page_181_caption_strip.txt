The image is a slide from a lecture about Artificial Intelligence. The slide is divided into three sections, each representing a different type of environment: an apartment, a laboratory, and a factory. Each section contains a series of images depicting various objects found in these environments, such as a cabinet, a door, a chair, a sink, a first aid kit, a trash can, a box, a light switch, a ceiling light, a printer, a basket, a keyboard, a TV, a blanket, a fridge, a table, a pan, a mining machine, a plastic drum, a wooden brush, a stool, a workbench, and more.

The slide also includes a "cognitive map" of the space, which is a grid of icons representing the different objects in the environment. This cognitive map is a tool used in AI to help machines understand and navigate their surroundings.

There are also three questions posed at the bottom of the slide, asking about the distance between the keyboard and the TV, the number of cabinets in the room, and the height of the stool. These questions are likely meant to test the viewer's understanding of the cognitive map and their ability to use it to answer questions about the environment.

Unfortunately, the slide does not contain any formulas or plots, so I cannot provide a description for those. However, I can provide a summary based on the information provided:

The slide is a visual representation of how AI can use cognitive maps to understand and interact with different environments. It shows that AI can recognize and differentiate between various objects in a space, and can use this information to navigate and perform tasks within that space.

The keywords that are most relevant to this slide are: Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Map, Environment, Objects, and Navigation.
