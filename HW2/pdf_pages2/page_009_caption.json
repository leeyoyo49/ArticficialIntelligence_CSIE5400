<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Sequence to Sequence Generation with Transformer Based Models". It explains the process of sequence to sequence generation using transformer models. The input sequence is denoted as X1, ..., XT and the output sequence as Y1, ..., YT. The transformer model is described as an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder, a neural network, analyzes the input and builds an intermediate representation, also known as a context vector. The decoder, another neural network component, analyzes this intermediate representation and creates an output. The slide also includes a diagram illustrating the flow of information from the input sequence through the encoder to the context vector, and then to the decoder to produce the output.

The keywords that can be extracted from this slide are: Sequence, Sequence Generation, Transformer, Encoder, Decoder, Neural Network, Intermediate Representation, Context Vector, Output, Input Sequence, Output Sequence, House, Red, La Casa, Rosa.

The plot in the slide is a flow diagram that visually represents the sequence of operations in a transformer model. It starts with an input sequence, goes through an encoder to create an intermediate (context) vector, which is then used by a decoder to generate an output sequence. The diagram uses arrows to indicate the direction of data flow and different colors to distinguish between the encoder and decoder components.
