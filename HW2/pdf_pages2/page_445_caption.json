1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "BLEU (3/4)" and discusses the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score, a metric used to evaluate the quality of machine translation. The slide explains that the geometric mean of BLEU scores with n between one and four has the best correlation with human evaluation, and this score is commonly adopted, known as MEAN_BLEU**. It also discusses penalizing short candidate translations, providing an example where a candidate translation is missing a piece of text with respect to the reference. However, the slide does not contain any formulas or plots.
