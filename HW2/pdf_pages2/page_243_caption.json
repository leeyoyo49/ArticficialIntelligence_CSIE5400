<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Existing object-centric info miss situational understanding" and discusses the limitations of object-centric information in artificial intelligence. The slide is divided into three sections: Vision, Object, Relation, and Scene Graph. The Vision section is not visible in the image. The Object section is represented by a photograph of children holding signs. The Relation section is also not visible. The Scene Graph section is a diagram showing the spatial relationships between the children and the signs they are holding.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, the Scene Graph diagram can be described as a visual representation of the relationships between objects in a scene. In this case, the diagram shows the children holding the signs, with arrows indicating the direction of the signs and the children.

The keywords that can be extracted from this slide are: "Artificial Intelligence", "Object-centric", "Situational Understanding", "Vision", "Relation", and "Scene Graph".
