<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "BERTScore" and discusses a method used to measure the quality of text summarization. It explains that BERTScore measures how similar the text summary is to the original text. The slide also addresses two common issues that n-gram-based metrics often encounter. The first issue is the incorrect matching of paraphrases due to semantically accurate expressions differing from the surface form of the reference text, which can lead to incorrect performance estimation. The second issue is n-grams' inability to capture long-range dependencies and penalize semantically significant reordering.

The slide does not contain any formulas, plots, or inline examples. The most relevant keyword from this slide would be "BertScore," "text summarization," "n-gram models," "paraphrases," and "performance estimation."

Since there is no plot or formula on the slide, there is nothing to describe in that regard.
