The slide is titled "Values of States" and discusses the recursive definition of value, which is similar to the concept of 'expectimax' in artificial intelligence. The main content of the slide is divided into two parts: a mathematical formula and a diagram.

The mathematical formula is as follows: V*(s) = max Q*(s, a), where V* is the value of state s, Q* is a function that takes state s and action a as input, and a is an action. This formula is used to calculate the maximum value of a state by considering all possible actions.

The diagram on the right side of the formula illustrates a state transition in a state-value function. It shows a state 's' and an action 'a' that leads to a new state 'a'. The value of the new state is calculated using the recursive formula. The diagram also includes a transition function 'T(s, a, s')', which represents the probability of transitioning from state s to state s' by taking action a.

The keywords from this slide are: Values of States, Recursive definition, Expectimax, State, Action, Transition function, State-value function, Maximum value, State s, Action a, New state a', and Transition probability.

The plot in the diagram is a visual representation of the recursive nature of the value function in state-value reinforcement learning. It helps to understand how the function works by showing the relationship between the current state, the action taken, and the resulting new state.
