The slide is titled "Sample Task: Reasoning about Colored Objects (2/3)" and is the 152nd slide in the presentation. It contains two types of questions related to reasoning about colored objects. The first type of question is "How many objects are not particular colors?" with an example provided: "On the table, there is a purple plate and a brown textbook. How many objects in total are neither purple nor brown?" The second type is asking "How are the objects ordered on the surface?" with another example: "You see the following items arranged in a row on the floor: a purple stuffed bear, a silver pair of sunglasses, a burgundy plate, a blue puzzle, and a mauve pencil. What is the color of the item directly to the right of the pair of silver sunglasses?"

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, it does contain keywords such as "Reasoning", "Colored Objects", "Question Types", "Examples", and "Order". These keywords are relevant to the content of the slide as they help to understand the type of questions being asked and the context in which they are being asked.
