The slide is titled "BLEU (3/4)" and discusses the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score, a metric used to evaluate the quality of machine translation. The slide explains that the geometric mean of BLEU scores with n between one and four has the best correlation with human evaluation, and this score is commonly adopted, known as MEAN_BLEU**. It also discusses penalizing short candidate translations, providing an example where a candidate translation is missing a piece of text with respect to the reference. However, the slide does not contain any formulas or plots.
