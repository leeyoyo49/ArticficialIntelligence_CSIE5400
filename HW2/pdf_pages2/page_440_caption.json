<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Potential for Self-Improvement" and discusses experiments conducted on Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmarks. It focuses on two specific benchmarks: CNN/Daily Mail (2016) and BBC (2021).

The CNN Daily Mail benchmark includes 286,817 training pairs, 13,368 validation pairs, and 11,487 test pairs. The source documents in the training set have an average of 766 words spanning 29.74 sentences, while the summaries consist of 53 words and 3.72 sentences.

The BBC benchmark, on the other hand, includes 2,225 BBC news website documents in five topical areas from 2004-2005.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, it does reference two sources: "Abstract text summarization using sequence-to-sequence RNNs and beyond," CoNLL 2016, and "Automated News Summarization Using Transformers," ICSAC 2021.
