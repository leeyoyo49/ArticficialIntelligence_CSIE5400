The slide is titled "Distribution Matching with NCFD" and contains a bullet point explaining that CF-based methods directly compare distributions by balancing the amplitude and phase in the complex plane, enhancing distributional similarity. Below the text, there is a plot with three subplots labeled "Iteration 0", "Iteration5000", and "Iteration10000". Each subplot shows a polar plot with two sets of data, one labeled "Real" and the other "Synthetic". The plots are color-coded with blue and red, representing the real and synthetic data respectively. The plots show the progression of the data over the iterations, with the synthetic data becoming more similar to the real data as the iterations increase. The slide number is 17.

There is no formula present on the slide.

The plot shows the comparison of real and synthesized data over three iterations. The real data is represented by the blue lines, while the synthesized data is shown in red. As the iterations progress, the red lines become closer to the blue ones, indicating that the distribution matching is improving over time. This suggests that the CF-based method is effective in enhancing the similarity between the distributions. The plot is a visual representation of the concept explained in the bullet point, demonstrating how the method works in practice.
