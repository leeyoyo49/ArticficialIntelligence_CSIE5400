The slide is titled "Problem Formulation (1/3)" and discusses the concept of a Language Model (LM) in the context of artificial intelligence. The slide explains that given a vocabulary Σ and an LM M, the model takes a token sequence of the question q = {q0, ..., qn} as input and predicts the next token using autoregressive modeling. The formula presented on the slide is: Ot+1 = M(q, {ot, ..., ot}), where q ∈ Σ^n and ot ∈ ∑. This formula represents the process of predicting the next word in a sequence based on the previous words and the given vocabulary.

The keywords that are most relevant to the content of the slide are: Problem Formulation, Language Model, Vocabulary, Token Sequence, Autoregressive Modeling, and Prediction.

The slide does not contain a plot or any other visual representation of data. It is a text-based slide with bullet points and a mathematical formula.
