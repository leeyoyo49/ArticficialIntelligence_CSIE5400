<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "LaVA-CoT," which stands for "Let Vision Language Models Reason Step-by-Step." The slide is divided into two main sections. The left section contains a flowchart with five steps, each represented by a speech bubble and an icon of a person. The steps are: "Briefly explain what steps you'll take," "Describe the contents of the image," "Outline a step-by-step thought process," "State the final answer in a clear format," and "Conclusion." Each step is associated with a specific task, such as summarizing, captioning, reasoning, answering, and concluding. The right section of the slide presents a similar flowchart, but with a different sequence of tasks: "Question," "Summary," "Caption," "Reasoning," "Answer." The tasks are color-coded and connected by arrows, indicating the flow of the process.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, it does reference the use of GPT-4o, which is a type of artificial intelligence model, in the process of generating summaries, captions, and reasoning. The slide also includes a source citation at the bottom, indicating that the content is based on a paper titled "LLaVA-CoT: Let Vision Language Model Reason Step by Step," published in arXiv in 2025.

In summary, the slide provides an overview of a process for using artificial intelligence models to reason and answer questions step by step. The process involves summarizing the question, describing the image, outlining a thought process, stating a clear answer, and drawing a conclusion. The use of color-coding and arrows in the flowchart helps to visually represent the sequence of these tasks.
