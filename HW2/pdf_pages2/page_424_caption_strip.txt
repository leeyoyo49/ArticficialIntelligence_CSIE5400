The slide is titled "Deep Q-Learning Networks (DQNs)" and discusses the concept of using a neural network to approximate the Q-function. The Q-function estimates the expected cumulative reward for each action in a given state. This approach, known as deep Q-learning, can handle environments with large state spaces and aims to enable agents to learn optimal actions in complex, high-dimensional environments.

The slide also includes a diagram illustrating the process of deep learning. The diagram shows a state represented by a yellow rectangle, which is connected to multiple nodes representing different actions. These nodes are then connected to a final node representing the Q-value of the action. This visual representation helps to understand how deep learning can be used in the context of Q-learning.

The keywords that are most relevant to the content of the slide are: Deep Learning, Q-Value, State, Neural Network, and Cumulative Reward.

There is no plot or formula shown on the slide.
