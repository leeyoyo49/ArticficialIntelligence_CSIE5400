The slide is titled "Problem Formulation (3/3)" and discusses the role of the LLM M as a policy mapping from the state space to the probability space over the action space in reinforcement learning. The objective of reinforcement learning is to train the policy to maximize the expected return, which is represented by the formula E[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R(q, o)|q ~ d_0, o_t ~ M(\cdot |s_t)]. The slide also mentions that with the evaluation reward, the LLL M can be updated using any RL algorithm to maximize reward. The most relevant keyword from the text is "Reinforcement Learning". The slide does not contain a plot or a formula that needs to be described in detail.
