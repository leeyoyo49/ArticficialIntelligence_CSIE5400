The slide is titled "Evaluation Metrics for Text Summarization" and discusses three different metrics used to evaluate text summarization: BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore. 

BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a method for automatic evaluation of machine translation. ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is another method for evaluating automatic summarization. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) Score is used for measuring semantic similarity.

The slide also provides three references for further reading on these topics.
