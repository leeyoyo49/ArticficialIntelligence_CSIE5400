The slide is titled "An Example of Coding (Codeforces task) (1/3)" and is the 23rd slide in the presentation. The main content of the slide is divided into several sections, each with a heading and corresponding text. The headings include "Our Prompt," "Problem," "Instruction," "Algorithms," "Tutorial," "Example Problems," and "Python3 code to solve the original problem." The text under each heading provides detailed information about the coding task, including the problem statement, instructions, algorithms, tutorial, example problems, and Python3 code. The slide does not contain any visual elements such as plots or formulas.
