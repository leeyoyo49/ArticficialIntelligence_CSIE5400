1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Multimodal CoT Reasoning" and discusses "Error Analysis" in the context of artificial intelligence. The most prevalent error type is "commonsense mistakes," which account for 80% of the errors. These mistakes occur when the model is faced with questions that require commonsense knowledge, such as interpreting maps, counting objects in images, or utilizing the alphabet. The slide also includes a pie chart that breaks down the types of errors into three categories: Commonsense (80%), Logical (14%), and Others (6%). The source of the information is cited as "Multidimensional Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Language Models," TMLR, 2024.

Keywords: Multimodal, CoT, Reasoning, Error Analysis, Commonsense, Logical, Others, Pie Chart, Artificial Intelligence.

The pie chart is a visual representation of the distribution of error types. It shows that the majority of errors (80%) are commonsense mistakes, followed by logical errors (14%) and other types (6%).

The formula for the pie chart cannot be provided as it is not a mathematical formula but a graphical representation of data.
