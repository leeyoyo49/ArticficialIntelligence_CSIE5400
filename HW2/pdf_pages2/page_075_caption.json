1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Agent Architecture" and is divided into two levels. Level 2 is about using Machine Learning Logic (MLLM) to reason, while Level 1 focuses on using MLLM to act. The slide includes a diagram that illustrates the flow of information and actions in an agent's architecture. The diagram shows a robot thinking about something, which is connected to a memory represented by a brain icon. This memory is linked to tool use, depicted by a wrench and screwdriver icon. The robot's actions are represented by an arrow pointing to the globe, indicating the agent's interaction with the environment. The source of the information is provided at the bottom of the slide. The keywords from this slide are "Agent", "Architecture", "Machine Learning Logic", "Reasoning", "Acting", and "Tool Use". There is no plot or formula in the slide to describe.
