The slide is titled "Exponential Moving Average" and discusses two types of averages: the traditional average and the exponential moving average. The traditional average is represented by the formula AVG(x) = 1/N Σ xn, where N is the number of samples and xn is the nth sample. It is noted that all N samples need to be available at once, and it is not suitable for streaming data. The exponential moving averaging, on the other hand, uses a running interpolation update formula: xn = (1 - α) * xn-1 + α * xn, with 0 < α < 1. This formula makes recent samples more important and forgets about the past samples, with the rate of forgetting depending on α. The slide does not contain any plots or other visual elements.
