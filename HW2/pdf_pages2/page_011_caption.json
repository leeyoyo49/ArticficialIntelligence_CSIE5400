1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Example: Language Translation with Transformers". It explains that transformers utilize an autoregressive approach for output generation. The slide includes a diagram of a transformer model, which consists of an encoder block and a decoder block. The encoder block processes the input sequence, while the decoder block generates the output sequence. The diagram shows the flow of information from the input to the output, with arrows indicating the direction of information flow. The input sequence is represented by green bars, and the output sequences are represented by red bars. The source of the information is cited as "https://huggingface.co/blog/encoder-decoder". The keywords related to this slide are "Language Translation", "Transformers", "Autoregressive", "Encoder Block", "Decoder Block", and "Output Generation". The slide does not contain a plot or a formula.
