The slide is titled "Various reasoning benchmarks are emerging" and falls under the category of "Relation Reasoning". It is part of the "MMBench [ECCV 2024]" series. The slide is divided into two main sections: "Social Relation" and "Nature Relation". Each section contains a question and four multiple-choice answers, with the correct answer indicated in green.

In the Social Relation section, the question is "What can be the relationship between the two persons in this image?" The options are: A. Father and daughter, B. Mother and son, C. Brother and sister, D. Husband and wife. The correct answer is D. The image shows a man and a woman sitting together at a table, suggesting they are husband and wife.

The Nature Relation section poses the question "In nature, what's the relation between these two creatures?" with the options: A, B, C, D being "Predatory relationships, Competitive relationships, Parasitic relationships, Symbiotic relationship" respectively. Each option is associated with an image: a lion and a cheetah, a bird and a gazelle, and a bird perched on the gazelle's horns respectively. The answer to this question is D, indicating a symbiotic relationship.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, it does provide an example of a multiple-choice question and answer format, which is a common method used in AI and machine learning to test reasoning and decision-making abilities.
