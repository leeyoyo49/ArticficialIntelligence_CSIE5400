The slide is titled "Example â€“ Gridworld Q* Values" and contains a grid with numerical values representing the Q* values in a gridworld environment after 100 iterations. The grid is divided into several sections with different colors: green, gray, and red. The green sections have values ranging from 0.29 to 0,85, the gray section has a value of 0., and the red section has values from -0.65 to -1.00. The slide does not contain any formulas or definitions, but it does show a plot of the gridworld with the mentioned values.

Summary:
The slide provides an example of Q* value distribution in a Gridworld environment. The values are represented in a 10x10 grid, with each cell containing a numerical value. The highest value in the grid is 1.0, located in the top right corner, while the lowest value is -1,00, found in the bottom right corner. The majority of the values are in the green section, indicating a higher Q-value in those areas. The gray and red sections have lower Q-values, suggesting less favorable states in the environment.

Plot Description:
The plot is a 2D grid with cells containing numerical values. The cells are color-coded: green for higher values, gray for a neutral value (0.), and red for lower values. This color-coding visually represents the distribution of Q-values across the grid.
