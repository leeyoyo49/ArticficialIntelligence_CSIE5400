The slide is titled "How to perform step by step reasoning without using demonstration examples?" and discusses the concept of "Analogical Prompting." It explains that the inspiration for this concept comes from analogical reasoning in psychology, where humans draw from relevant past experiences to tackle new problems. The slide provides an example of how humans often think about "do I know a related problem?" and recall how they solved related problems in the past to derive insights for solving the new problem. The source of the information is cited as "Large Language Models as Analogical Reasoners," ICLR, 2024.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, it does mention the use of large language models as analogical reasoners.
