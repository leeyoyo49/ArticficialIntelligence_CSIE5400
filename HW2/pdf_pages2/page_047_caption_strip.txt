The slide is titled "Example: Stable Diffusion" and discusses the process of stable diffusion in the context of image synthesis. The slide is divided into three main sections: Pixel Space, Latent Space, and Conditioning. 

In the Pixel Space section, the slide explains the denoising step, cross-attention, switch, skip connection, and concatenation process. The Pixel Space is represented by a pink rectangle with the variables x and D inside it. 

The Latent space section is depicted by a green rectangle and contains the Diffusion Process and Denoising U-Net εθ. The Diffusion process is a series of steps that transform the input data into a latent space representation. The Dnoising U-net εθ is a type of neural network that is used to denoise the data in the latent space.

The Conditioning section includes Semantic Map, Text, Representations, and Images. These elements are used to condition the diffusion process and influence the final output of the image synthesis.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. The source of the information is a paper titled "High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models," published in CVPR in 2022.
