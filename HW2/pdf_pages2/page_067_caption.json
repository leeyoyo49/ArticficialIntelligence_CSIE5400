<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Example: RT-2: Vision-Language-Action Models [PLMR 2023]" and is associated with Google DeepMind. The main content of the slide is a question "What should the robot do to <task>?" followed by a series of numbers "A: = 132 114 128 5 25 156". Below the question, there is a diagram illustrating the process of a robot performing a task. The diagram includes a large language model, a vision-language-action model (ViLT), and a robot action. The language model is connected to the ViLT, which then connects to the robot action.

The slide also includes a formula "Δ T = [0.1, -0.2, 0]" and "Δ R = [10°, 25°, -7°]". These formulas represent the changes in the task and the robot's position, respectively.

The keywords from this slide are "RT-2", "Vision-Language Action Models", "Google DeepMind", "Language Model", "ViLT", "Robot Action", "Task", "Delta T", and "Delta R".

There is no plot shown on the slide.
