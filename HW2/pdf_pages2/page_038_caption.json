1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Text to Image Generation with Diffusion Based Models" and discusses the diffusion process. It explains that diffusion models are inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics and that for a small fraction of time, it is difficult to determine whether particles are moving in the direction of mixing or in the opposite direction. The slide also includes a series of images showing the process of diffusion in a beaker of liquid, with red and blue dots representing particles. The source of the information is provided at the bottom of the slide.
