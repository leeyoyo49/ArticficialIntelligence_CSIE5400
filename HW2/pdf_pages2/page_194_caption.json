1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "How to perform step by step reasoning without using demonstration examples?" and discusses the concept of "Analogical Prompting." It explains that the inspiration for this concept comes from analogical reasoning in psychology, where humans draw from relevant past experiences to tackle new problems. The slide provides an example of how humans often think about "do I know a related problem?" and recall how they solved related problems in the past to derive insights for solving the new problem. The source of the information is cited as "Large Language Models as Analogical Reasoners," ICLR, 2024.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, it does mention the use of large language models as analogical reasoners.
