The slide is titled "Performance on 'Winoground'" and discusses a task of correctly matching two given images and captions. The task involves four questions, each asking if a caption matches an image. The images are of a lightbulb surrounded by plants, and the captions are slightly different descriptions of the same scene. The slide also includes a table showing the results of the Winoground task across text, image, and group score metrics for different models. The models include MTurk Human, VQ2 (Yarom et al., 2023), PALI (Chen et al ., 2022), BLP-2 (Li et al . , 2021), GPT4-V (Wu et al ,2023) and MICL (FLAN-T5-XXL). The scores range from 26.00 to 89.50. The source of the information is a paper titled "Winogrund: Probing Vision and Language Models for Visio-Linguistic Compositionality," published in CVPR,2022.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, it does include a bar graph showing the performance of different models on the task. The graph is not labeled, but it appears to show the scores of the models in ascending order. The highest score is achieved by the MTturk Human model, while the lowest score is by the BLP2 model. The other models' scores fall in between these two extremes.
