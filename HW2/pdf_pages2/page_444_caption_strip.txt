The slide is titled "BLEU (2/4)" and discusses the concept of "Computing n-grams precision" in the context of evaluating the quality of machine-translated text. The slide explains that a method to achieve higher scores for well-formed sentences is to consider matching 2-grams or 3-grams instead of 1-grams only. It introduces two types of scores: BLEU**1, which considers only 1-grams, and BLEU*2, which only considers 2-grams.

An example is provided to illustrate the concept. The reference sentence (R) is "There is a cat on the mat." Two candidate sentences (C1 and C2) are given. C1 is a direct translation of the reference, while C2 is a slightly different phrasing. The BLEU scores for both candidate sentences are calculated based on the number of 2-Grams that appear in the reference sentence. For C1, all 6 of the 2-Grams appear on the reference R, resulting in a BLEU score of 7/7 = 1.0 for both types of scoring. However, for C2, not all 2-grams from C1 appear in R, which results in a lower BLEU-1 score and a 0 score for BLEU2.

The slide does not contain any visual elements such as plots or formulas, so there is no description of a plot or formula to provide. The keywords related to the content of the slide are: BLEURT, BLEU, n-gram, precision, machine translation, reference sentence, candidate sentence, translation quality, and scoring.

In summary, the slide provides an explanation of the BLEU scoring method used in machine translation to evaluate translation quality. It emphasizes the importance of considering 2 and 3 grams in addition to 1 grams for a more accurate assessment. The example given demonstrates how the presence or absence of specific 2 grams in a candidate sentence can affect the resulting score.
