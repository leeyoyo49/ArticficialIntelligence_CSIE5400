1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Text to Image Generation with Diffusion Based Models" and discusses the concept of generating photorealistic images given any text input, a process known as conditional generation. The slide includes a diagram illustrating the process of text to image generation using diffusion-based models. The diagram shows a flow from text input to image output, with intermediate steps represented by purple bars. The text input is represented by an orange rectangle, and the image output is shown as a pixelated image on the right side of the diagram. The source of the information is provided at the bottom of the slide.
