<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "AI Weekly" and is the third slide in a series. The main content of the slide is divided into two sections: a flowchart on the left and a series of graphs on the right.

The flowchart is a representation of a process in artificial intelligence. It starts with an "original block" which then goes through two stages: "Attention / FFN" and "Layer Norm". The output from this process is then passed through a "scale & shift" operation, resulting in the final "output".

The graphs are scatter plots that show the relationship between the input and output of different layers in a neural network. The layers are labeled as "ViT LN layer 5", "wav2vec LN layers 5, 30, 35, 40", and "DiT LN Layers 5 and 13, 21, 28". The graphs show that as the layer number increases, the output becomes more spread out and less linear.

The slide also introduces the concept of "Dynamic Tanh (DyT)" with the formula "DyT(x) = tanh(αx)". This is a mathematical function that is used in the process represented by the flowchart.
