The slide presents the concept of "Transfer text event knowledge to images" in the field of Artificial Intelligence. The slide is divided into three main sections: Caption Text, Image, and Information Extraction.

The Caption Text section provides a detailed description of an event, stating that antigovernment protesters carried an injured man on a stretcher after clashes with riot police on Independence Square in Kyiv on February 20, 2014.

The Image section displays a photograph of the event, with several individuals labeled as "Person" and a "Bench" visible in the background.

The Information Extraction section contains a table with three columns: Event Type, Transport (carry), Agent, Target, and Instrument. The table lists the event type as "carry", the agent as "protesters", the target as "injured man", and the instrument as "stretcher".

The slide also mentions "Weakly Supervision" as a method used in the process.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, it does reference a source titled "Knowledge-Driven Vision-Language Encoding" from CVPR, 2023.

In summary, the slide provides a comprehensive overview of how AI can be used to extract and transfer information from text to images, using a specific event as an example. The keywords related to this slide could be "Artificial Intelligence", "Caption Text", "Image", "Information Extraction", "Event Type", "Transport (carry)", "Agent", "Target", "Instrument", and "Weak Supervision".
