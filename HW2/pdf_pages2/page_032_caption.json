1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "The Transformer Decoder Block (3)" and is the 32nd slide in the presentation. The main content of the slide is a diagram illustrating the architecture of a transformer decoder block. The diagram is divided into two main parts: the Transformer Decoder and the Masked Multi-head Self-Attention. The Transformer Decoder is represented by a series of layers, each containing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Layer Normalization step. The Masked Mult-head Self-attention is a part of the transformer decoder that only interacts with past inputs, as indicated by the text on the slide.

The diagram uses different colors to distinguish between the different components of the architecture. The input tokens are represented by pink rectangles, the output tokens by green rectangles, and the attention weights by purple rectangles. The attention weights are multiplied by the input tokens to produce the output, as shown by the arrows in the diagram.

The slide does not contain any written content such as bullet points or definitions, nor does it contain any formulas or inline examples. However, it does mention that most of the network is the same as the transformer encoder, and that the masked multi-head self-attention only interacts avec past inputs.
