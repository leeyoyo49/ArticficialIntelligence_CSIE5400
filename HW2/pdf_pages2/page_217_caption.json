<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Multimodal Reasoning" and discusses an "Example Problem: Text-to-image reference". The problem involves describing the contents of four images of a tree at different growth stages. The images are labeled as follows: Image 0 is just germinating, Image 1 is only a bare trunk, and Image 2 is luxuriant. Image 3 is a growing plant. The source of the content is cited as "MMICL: Empowering Vision-language Model with Multi-Modal In-Context Learning, ICLR, 2024."

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, it does provide a visual representation of the growth stages of a plant, which can be used to understand the concept of multimodal reasoning in artificial intelligence. Multimodal reasoning refers to the ability of a system to process and integrate information from multiple sources or modalities, such as text and images, to make decisions or solve problems.

The keywords that are most relevant to the content of the slide are: Multimodality, Reasoning, Artificial Intelligence, Text-to-Image, Reference, Growth Stages, and Plant.

The formula that is mentioned in the slide is not a mathematical formula but a reference to a source of information. It is written as: "Source: MMICL; Empowering vision-language model with multi-modal in-context learning; ICLR; 2023."
