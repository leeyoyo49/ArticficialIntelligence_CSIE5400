The slide is titled "Approximate Q-Learning" and discusses the concept of using a feature representation to write a Q function for any state using a few weights. The Q function is represented by two formulas: V(s) = w1*f1(s) + w2*f2(s) ... + wn*fn(s) and Q(s, a) = wi*fi(s,a) + wi+1*fi+1(s,a)... + wi+n*fi+n(s,a). The advantage of this approach is that the experience is summed up in a few powerful numbers, but the disadvantage is that states may share features but actually be very different in value. An example is given of two states that would have the same value if ghost positions are not included as a feature. The slide does not contain any plots or formulas that need to be described or saved.
