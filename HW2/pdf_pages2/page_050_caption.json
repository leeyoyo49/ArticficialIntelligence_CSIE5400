<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Multimodal Embedding Spaces" and discusses the concept of Multimodal Learning. It explains that the multi-modal nature of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models is powered by two encoder models, a Text encoder and an Image encoder, which are trained to "speak the same language". The slide also includes a diagram illustrating the process of multimodal learning, where text and image data are processed through their respective encoders and then combined in a multimodal embedding space. The diagram shows three examples: a mountain landscape, an astronaut riding a horse, and an intergalactic goldfish, each processed through the text encoder and the image encoder, resulting in a set of numerical values. These values are then plotted in a 2D space, with each example represented by a point. The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. The keywords from this slide are: Multimodality, Embedding, Spaces, Learning, MLP, Text encoder, Image encoder.
