The slide is titled "Example: Model-Based Learning" and is divided into three main sections: "Input Policy π", "Observed (s, a, s', R) Transitions", and "Learned Model". The slide does not contain any images, plots, or formulas, but it does present a table with observed transitions and a learned model with corresponding values.

The table in the "Observed Transitions" section lists four episodes, each with a sequence of states, actions, and rewards. The states are represented by the letters A, B, C, D, and E, and the actions are labeled as east, north, or exit. The rewards are numerical values, with positive values indicating a reward and negative values indicating no reward or a penalty. The transitions show the movement from one state to another based on the action taken.

The learned model section contains two formulas: "T(s, a)" and "R(s, s')". These formulas represent the transition and reward functions learned from the observed transitions. The transition function "T" maps a state and an action to the next state, while the reward function "R" maps an initial state, an action, and a next state to the reward received.

The keywords from this slide that are most relevant to the topic of artificial intelligence are: "Model-Based Learning", "Transition", "Reward", "State", "Action", "Episode", "Policy", "π", "T", "R", "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "Exit", "North", "East".

Since there is no plot or formula to describe, the summary of the slide is as follows: The slide presents an example of model-based learning in artificial intelligence. It shows how an input policy is used to observe transitions between states based on actions taken, and how these transitions are used to learn a model that predicts the outcome of actions in different states. The learned model consists of two functions: the transition function, which maps states and actions to next states, and an unspecified reward function.
