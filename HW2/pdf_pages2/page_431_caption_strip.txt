The slide is titled "Tricks for handling a constantly changing input and output" and discusses the concept of "Experience Replay" in the context of Q-learning. The slide explains that instead of running Q-learning on state/action pairs as they occur during simulation or the actual experience, the stored data (state, action, reward, next_state) is replayed. An example is given of building a video game bot, where each frame of the game represents a different state. During training, a random batch of 64 frames from the last 100,000 frames is sampled to train the network. The keywords from this slide are: Experience Replay, Q-learning, State/Action Pairs, Simulation, Actual Experience, Stored Data, State, Action, Reward, Next State, Video Game Bot, Frames, Training, Network.

The slide does not contain any plots or formulas.
