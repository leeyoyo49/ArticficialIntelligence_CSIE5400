1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Multimodal CoT Reasoning" and discusses a problem related to the magnetic force between magnets. The problem asks which of the following statements is true, given the context that the images below show two pairs of magnets and that all the magnets are made of the same material. The options are: (A) The magnitude of the magnetic field is smaller in Pair 2, (B) The magnetic force is smaller for Pair 1, (C) The force is the same for both pairs.

The slide provides two solutions to the problem. The first solution, labeled "Gold Rationale," explains that the direction of the force is affected by whether the magnets attract or repel, but not the magnitude. It states that the sizes of the magnets and the distance between them affect the magnitude, and since the sizes and distance are the same in both pairs, the magnitude is also the same. The answer given is (C).

The second solution, "Baseline" and "+ Vision Features," is similar to the first but includes additional details about the distance affecting the force and the fact that the distance is greater between the magnets in pair 2.

The keywords from this slide are: Multimodal, CoT, Reasoning, Problem, Question, Context, Options, Gold Rationale, Baseline, Vision Features, Answer, Magnitude, Magnetic Force, Magnets, Attract, Repel, Distance.

There is no plot or formula on the slide, but there are two images of magnets, one labeled "Pair 1" with a distance of 30.7 mm, and the other labeled "Vision" with the same distance. The images are used to illustrate the context of the problem.

The formula for magnetic force (F) between two magnets is given by F = (μ₀ * (m₁ * m₂)) / (4 * π * r²), where μ₀ is the permeability of free space, m₁ and m₂ are the magnetic moments of the two magnets, and r is the distance separating them. However, this formula is not explicitly shown on the image.
