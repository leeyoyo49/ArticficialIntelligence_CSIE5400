1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Existing object-centric info miss situational understanding" and is divided into two sections: "Vision" and "Object". The Vision section contains a photograph of a group of people holding signs with messages such as "NO Mandate!" and "Brady's NBT Domestic". The Object section is empty. The slide also includes a source citation at the bottom: "Knowledge-Driven Vision-Language Encoding," Tutorial, CVPR, 2023.

The slide seems to be discussing the limitations of object-centric information in understanding situational contexts. The photograph in the Vision section might be used as an example to illustrate this point. However, without more context, it's difficult to provide a detailed summary of the slide's content.

As for the keywords, they might include "Object-centric information", "situational understanding", "Vision", "Object", and "Mandate". However, these are just educated guesses based on the visible text on the slide.
