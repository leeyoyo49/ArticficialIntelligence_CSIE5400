<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "BERTScore Architecture" and discusses the architecture of BERTScore, a metric used to evaluate the quality of text generated by a model. The slide is divided into three main sections: Contextual Embedding, Pairwise Cosine Similarity, and Maximum Similarity with optional Importance Weighting.

In the first section, "Contextual Embeddings," the slide explains that the BERT model is used to generate embeddings for both the reference and candidate sentences. The reference sentence is "the weather is cold today," and the candidate sentence being evaluated is "it is freezing today." These sentences are represented by images of a character with different facial expressions.

The second section shows a matrix of pairwise cosine similarities between the embeddings of the words in the sentences. This matrix is a visual representation of how similar the words are to each other in the context of the sentences.

The third section presents a heatmap of maximum similarity scores between the candidate and reference words. The heatmap is color-coded, with darker colors indicating higher similarity scores. This section also includes an optional step of importance weighting, which adjusts the scores based on the importance of each word in the sentence.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. However, it does provide an example of how to calculate the final BERT score using the formula: R_BERT = (0.713×1.27)+(0.515×7.94)+... / (1×2.27+7×94+1.82+7.90+8.88).
