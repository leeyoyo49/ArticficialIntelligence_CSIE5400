The slide is titled "Example Predictions of Toolformer" and contains four bullet points. The first bullet point states that The New England Journal of Medicine is a registered trademark of the Massachusetts Medical Society. The second bullet point provides a calculation showing that out of 1400 participants, 400 (or 29%) passed the test. The third bullet point explains that the name "Brown Act" derives from "la tortuga," the Spanish word for turtle. The fourth bullet point describes the Brown Act as California's law that guarantees the public's right to attend and participate in meetings of local legislative bodies, requiring these bodies to hold their meetings open to the public.

The slide does not contain any images, plots, or formulas, so there is no plot description or formula to provide. The keywords from this slide that are most relevant to the topic of artificial intelligence are "Toolformer," "Massachusetts Medical Society," "29%," and "California's law."

Here is the formula from the bullet point about the test results:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of participants who passed} \times 100}{\text{Total number of participants}} \right) \]

In this case, the formula would be:

\[ 29\% = \frac{400}{1400} \]
