The slide is titled "Dataset Distillation" and discusses the concept of dataset distillation as a powerful approach for reducing data requirements in deep learning. Dataset distillation involves condensing a large, real dataset into a smaller, synthetic one. The slide also includes a diagram that illustrates the process of distillation. The diagram shows a flow from 50k real training images to 10 synthetic training images, and then to a neural network. The neural network is shown to have similar test performance to the original. The keywords that can be extracted from this slide are: Dataset Distillation, Data Requirements, Deep Learning, Condensing, Real Dataset, Synthetic Dataset, Neural Network, and Test Performance.

The formula presented in the slide is not explicitly given, but it can be inferred that the process involves reducing the size of the dataset while maintaining similar performance. The formula could be represented as: Real Dataset -> Distillation -> Synthetic Dataset -> Neural Network -> Similar Test Performance.
