Based on the image provided, here is a detailed analysis of the lecture slide:

1. **Written Content Extraction:**
   - Slide Title: Artificial Intelligence
   - Sub-bullet 1: Reasoning Problems
     - Question: "Subtract all tiny shiny balls. Subtract all purple objects. How many objects are left? Options: A. 4, B. 8, C. 2, D. 6"
     - Answer from Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruction: "Given that we have already removed all the shiny balls and there were no purple objects to begin with, the correct answer is C.2, as initially, there were 2 purple objects, but they are not to be subtracted according to the instruction."
     - Summary stage: "What's the problem? What should I do?"
     - Caption stage: What can I know from the image? "The image shows various 3D geometric shapes on a flat surface, including spheres, cubes, and cylinders in different colors. Notably, there are small shiny green spheres and a purple cylinder."
   - Example 2: "Science Problems"
   - Image Description: A rectangular block of acetal polymer fixed between two rigid plates. The top plate moves horizontally by 2 mm when a force P=2 kN is applied. The block's dimensions are given as 400 mm in length, 200 mm in height, and 100 mm in width.
   - Reasoning stage: How to solve the problem step-by-step? "To determine the shear modulus of the polymer, we can use the formula for shear modulus in a small angle analysis: \(\Gamma = \frac{F}{A} \cdot \frac{\Delta x}{L}\) where \(\gamma\) is the shear strain, \(\Delta x\) and \(L\) are the horizontal displacement and the original length of the block, respectively. Given that the displacement is horizontal and the block's original length is 400mm, the shear modulus is calculated as \(\frac{2000}{40,000 \times 0.01} = 5 \text{MPa}\)"
   - Conclusion: "What is the final answer? 5 MPa"

2. **Summary of the Slide:**
The slide presents two examples of problems related to artificial intelligence. The first example is a reasoning problem involving the subtraction of objects based on their properties, while the second example involves a science problem requiring the calculation of shear modulus using a given formula. Both examples demonstrate the application of artificial intelligence in problem-solving and decision-making processes.

4. **Plot Description:**
There is no plot shown on the slide.

5. **Formula in LaTex Format:**
\(\Gamma=\frac{P}{A}\cdot\frac{\text{Delta x}}{L}\)

This formula is used to calculate the shear stress in a material subjected to a force, which is a fundamental concept in materials science and engineering.
