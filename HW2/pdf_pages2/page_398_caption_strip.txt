The slide is titled "Example: Direct Evaluation" and is divided into three main sections: "Input Policy Ï€", "Observed (s, a, s', R) Transitions", and "Output Values". The slide does not contain any formulas or definitions, but it does provide an example of how to calculate the value of a state in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) using the direct evaluation method. The slide also includes a diagram of a grid with states A, B, C, D, and E, and arrows indicating possible transitions between these states. The output values for each state are also provided in a table. The keywords that are most relevant to this slide are: "Direct Evaluation", "Markov Decision Problem", "State", "Transition", "Output Value", "Discounted Reward", "MDP", "Grid", "States", "Transitions", "Policy", "Value Function", "Episode", "Assumption", "Sum", "Average". The plot in the slide is a grid diagram representing the states and transitions in an MDP. The formula for the value function V(s) is given as the sum of discounted rewards from the end, averaged over all encounters of s.
