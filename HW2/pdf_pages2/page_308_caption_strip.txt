The slide is titled "Example: Racing" and features an illustration of a blue car driving on a winding road. The car appears to be in motion, and the road curves to the left. The background of the slide is white, and there is a blue horizontal line at the top. The illustration is simple and cartoonish, with no additional details or text.

The slide does not contain any written content, formulas or definitions, or inline examples. Therefore, there is no plot to describe, and no formula to save in LaTex format. The keywords that can be identified from the image are "Example," "Racing," "car," "road," "motion," and "illustration."

In summary, the slide presents a visual example of a racing scenario, with a cartoonish blue car navigating a curving road. This could be used to illustrate concepts related to motion, speed, or competition in the context of artificial intelligence. However, without additional context or text, it is difficult to provide a more detailed explanation or summary.
