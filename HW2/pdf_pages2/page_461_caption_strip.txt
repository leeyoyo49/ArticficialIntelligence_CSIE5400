The slide is titled "Evaluations" and is divided into two main sections. The first section is a table that compares the performance of different AI models on various tasks. The tasks include "Reasoning about Colored Objects," "Logical Deduction," "Tracking Shuffled Objects," and "Object Counting." The models compared are RLFT, DG, SC, Self-train, Self-refine, Best-of-N, RLAIF, and RLC. Each model's performance is represented by a percentage score for each task.

The second section of the slide is a bar chart titled "Performance on summarization task." The chart compares the BERTScore of three models: DG, Self-Train, and BLC. The scores are represented by the height of the bars, with DG having the highest score of 0.886, followed by BLC with a score slightly lower than DG, and Self-Train with the lowest score.

The slide does not contain any formulas or inline examples. However, it does provide a visual representation of the data through the table and bar chart, allowing for easy comparison of the models' performance on different tasks.

The most relevant keyword from the table is "Evaluating," as it is the main focus of the table.
