The slide presents a comparison between Offline (MDPs) and Online (RL) solutions in the context of artificial intelligence. The Offline Solution, represented by a robot thinking about a problem, suggests that the policy is computed ahead of time. On the other hand, the Online Learning solution, depicted by the same robot but in a different scenario, indicates that the robot computes the policy as it experiences new situations.

The slide does not contain any formulas or plots, so there is no need to save any content in LaTex format or describe a plot. However, the concept of MDPs (Markov Decision Processes) and RL (Reinforcement Learning) are relevant keywords in this context.

The summary of the slide is as follows:

The slide compares two approaches to problem-solving in artificial intelligence: Offline and Online Learning. In the Offline approach, the policy or strategy is pre-computed before the robot encounters any real-world scenarios. This is represented by the robot in the first image, which appears to be contemplating a problem. In contrast, Online Learning involves the robot computing the policy in real-time as it encounters new situations. This dynamic approach allows the robot to adapt and learn from its experiences, as depicted in the second image where the robot seems to be reacting to an unexpected situation. The slide uses visual metaphors to illustrate these concepts, with the robot's actions symbolizing the computation of policy in each approach. The keywords associated with this slide are "Offline Solution," "Online Learning," "MDPs," "RL," and "policy."
