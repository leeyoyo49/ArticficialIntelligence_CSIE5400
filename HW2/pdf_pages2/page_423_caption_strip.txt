The slide is titled "Reinforcement Learning with Neural Network" and discusses the concept of Deep Q-Learning, a reinforcement learning technique that combines Q-learning with deep neural networks. The slide poses the question "Why Deep Q-learning?" and provides an example of an environment with 10,000 states and 1,000 actions per state, which would create a table of 10 million cells. A diagram on the slide illustrates the relationship between the state, action, and Q-value in Q-learning, with the state and action represented by yellow and green boxes, respectively, and the Q-value represented by a blue box. The formula for Q-learning is not explicitly provided on this slide, but it is a fundamental concept in reinforcement learning that calculates the expected return of taking a certain action in a given state and following the optimal policy thereafter. The keywords from this slide that are most relevant to the topic of artificial intelligence are: Reinforcement Learning, Neural Network, Deep Q Learning, State, Action, Q-Value.
