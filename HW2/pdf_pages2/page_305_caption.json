1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "This Lecture – Agenda" and contains a list of topics that will be covered in the lecture. The topics include Markov Decision Processes (MDP), Reinforcement Learning, and a Case Study on Language Model Self-improvement. The slide does not contain any images, plots, or formulas, so there is no additional information to provide in those areas. The keywords from this slide that are most relevant to the topic of Artificial Intelligence are: Markov, Decision Processes, MDP, Reinforcement, Learning, Passive, Active, Approximate, Case Study, and Language Model.
