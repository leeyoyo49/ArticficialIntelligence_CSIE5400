1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.

The first type of prompt is the Correctness Evaluation Prompt (CEP), which asks if the answer to a question is correct and provides a reward based on the evaluation result, ranging from 0 to 1. The second type is the Quality Estimation Prompt (QEP), which requests an evaluation score from 1 to 10 for the answer. The slide does not contain any formulas or plots, and there are no inline examples provided. The keywords related to the content of the slide are: Self-evaluation, Reward, RLC, CEP, QEP, Correctness, Quality, Evaluation, Prompt, Answer, Question, Score, 0-1, 1-10, 172.
