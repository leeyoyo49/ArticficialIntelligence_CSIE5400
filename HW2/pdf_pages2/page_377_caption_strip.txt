The slide is titled "Comparison" and discusses the differences between value iteration and policy iteration in the context of dynamic programming for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). 

Value iteration updates both the values and the policy implicitly with every iteration, without explicitly tracking the policy. Instead, the maximum over actions is taken implicitly to recompute the policy.

Policy iteration, on the other hand, involves several passes that update utilities with a fixed policy. Each pass is fast because only one action is considered, not all of them. After the policy is evaluated, a new policy is chosen, which is slow like a value iteration pass. The new policy will be better, or the process will be done.

Both methods are dynamic programs for solving MDPs.
