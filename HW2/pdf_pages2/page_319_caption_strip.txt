The slide is titled "Discounting" and discusses the concept of maximizing the sum of rewards in decision-making. It suggests that it is reasonable to prefer rewards now over rewards later, and proposes a solution where the values of rewards decay exponentially over time. The slide uses three images to illustrate this concept: a diamond labeled "Worth Now," a diamond with a question mark "Worth Next Step," and a pile of broken diamonds "Worth In Two Steps." The slide does not contain any formulas or plots.

Keywords: Discounting, rewards, decision-making, time, exponential decay.

The formula mentioned in the slide is not explicitly given, but it can be inferred that the value of rewards decays exponentially, which can be represented as V = V0 * e^(-rt), where V is the value at time t, V0 is the initial value, r is the decay rate, and t is the time.
