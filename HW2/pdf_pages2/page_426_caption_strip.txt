The slide is titled "Training DQNs" and discusses the simplification of the Q-learning algorithm by replacing the Q-table with a neural network. The main content of the slide is a mathematical formula that represents the update rule for the Q-value in Q-learning. The formula is as follows:

Q(st, at) <- Q(st,at) + α[rt+1 + γ max Q(st+1, a) - Q(st,a)]

This formula is color-coded to indicate different components of the formula:

- The current Q-table value we are updating is represented by the color blue.
- The learning rate is represented in purple.
- Reward is represented with a green color.
- Discount is shown in yellow.
- Estimated reward from our next action is depicted in pink.

The slide number is 141.

The keywords that are most relevant to the content of this slide are: Q-learning, neural network, Q-table, learning rate, reward, discount, and estimated reward.

There is no plot shown on the slide.

The formula is already provided in a standard LaTex format. It represents the Bellman Optimality Equation, which is a fundamental concept in reinforcement learning. The equation states that the optimal Q-value for a state-action pair is the sum of the immediate reward and the discounted maximum Q-value of the next state. This equation is used to update the Q-values during the training process of a reinforcement learning agent.
