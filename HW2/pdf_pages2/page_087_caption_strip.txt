The slide is titled "Voyager [TMLR 2024] - A procedural memory of skills". The objective of the slide is to leverage MLLMs (i.e., OpenAI's APIs) for improved game mechanics understanding. The innovative features introduced are an automatic curriculum and a skill library. The automatic curriculum proposes increasingly complex tasks, while the skill library serves as a learning and evolution basis. An iterative prompting mechanism refines the program and incorporates it into the library as a new skill. The slide does not contain any formulas or plots. The keywords from this slide are: Voyager, TMLR, 2023, procedural memory, skills, MLLM, OpenAI, APIs, game mechanics, understanding, automatic curriculum, skill library, learning, evolution, iterative prompting, program, new skill.

The slide suggests that Voyager is an open-ended agent with large language models that can be used to improve the understanding of game mechanics. This is achieved by leveraging the capabilities of these models. The introduction of an automated curriculum and skill library are innovative features that contribute to this goal. The automated curriculum proposes tasks that become increasingly complex, allowing the system to learn and adapt over time. The skill library acts as a repository of skills that the system can learn from and evolve with. The system uses an iterative prompting method to refine its program and incorporate new skills into its library. This continuous learning and adaptation process is key to the success of the system in understanding and improving game mechanics.
