The slide is titled "Results" and is divided into two main sections: "Base Model" and "RECAP". The "Base model" section contains three images: a pizza near a pineapple, a person made of cutlery, and two flowers, one blue and the other green. The "ReCAP" section also contains the same three images, but they appear to be different versions of the same images.

The slide does not contain any written content such as definitions or formulas, nor does it contain any plots or formulas to describe. Therefore, it is not possible to generate a summary, select keywords, describe a plot or formula, or save a formula in LaTex format based on this slide.

However, the slide seems to be demonstrating the results of an AI model's ability to generate or manipulate images. The images in the "BaseModel" section might be the original images that the AI model was trained on, while the images in "ReCap" could be the output of the model after it has been trained. This suggests that the slide might be discussing a topic related to image generation or manipulation using AI.

Keywords that could be relevant to this slide include: AI, image generation, image manipulation, AI model, training, output, results, pineapple, pizza, cutlery person, flowers, blue flower, green flower.
