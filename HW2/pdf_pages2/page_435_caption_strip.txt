The slide is titled "Potential for Self-Improvement" and discusses experiments conducted on Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmarks. It specifically mentions "Benchmark#1 (reasoning)" and "Bigbench-hard (2023)" which includes multiple reasoning tasks consisting of multiple-choice and direct-generation tasks. The slide also introduces "BIG-bench", a collaborative benchmark intended to probe large language models and extrapolate their future capabilities. The more than 200 tasks included in BIG-bench are designed to test the reasoning abilities of these models.

The slide does not contain any formulas, plots, or inline examples. However, it does provide a link to a Google Drive file for more information on BIG-benchmark.

The keywords from this slide that are most relevant to the topic of Artificial Intelligence are: "NLP", "Benchmarks", "Reasoning", "Multiple-choice", "Direct-generation", "Language models", "Future capabilities", and "Self-improvement".

As there are no plots or formulas on the slide, there is no description of a plot or formula to provide.
