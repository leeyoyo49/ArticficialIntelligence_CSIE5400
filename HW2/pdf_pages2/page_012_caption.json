<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Example: Language Translation with Transformers". It explains the concept of autoregressive generation, which is the inference-time procedure of iteratively calling a model with its own generated outputs, given a few initial inputs. The slide is divided into two main steps, each illustrated with a diagram.

In Step 1, the diagram shows a sequence of encoder blocks, each taking an input and passing it to the next encoder block. The inputs are represented by the words "I", "want", "to", "buy", "a", "car", and "EOS" (end of sentence). The output of the last encoder block is then passed to the first decoder block, which outputs the word "BOS" (beginning of sentence).

In the Step 2 diagram, the output from the encoder blocks is passed to a series of decoder blocks. Each decoder block outputs a word, and the output of one decoder block is used as the input for the next. The final output is "Ich" (I in German).

The slide does not contain any formulas or definitions, but it does provide an example of how a transformer model can be used for language translation. The diagrams are simple and clear, making it easy to understand the process of language translation with transformers.

Keywords: Autoregressive Generation, Inference-time Procedure, Model, Initial Inputs, Encoder Blocks, Decoder Blocks, Language Translation, Transformers, BOS, EOS.
