The slide is titled "Achieved performances of this paper" and discusses the results of a study on artificial intelligence. The main content of the slide is a graph that plots the test accuracy percentage against the image per class (IPC). The graph shows two lines, one for NCFM (ours) and one for DATM, indicating the performance of these two methods. The NCFMA line starts at 26G with a test accuracy of around 20% and ends at 730G with an accuracy close to 60%. The DATM line starts slightly higher at 1.4G and ends slightly lower at 2.3G. The slide also includes a table that shows the speedup of the methods in terms of seconds per iteration. The table indicates that the speed of DATM is 8.8 seconds at IPC 1 and increases to 15.6 seconds at 100 IPC. The graph also includes markers for different GPU memory sizes, such as 2G, 20G, and 300G, showing how the performance varies with different memory sizes.

The slide does not contain any formulas or inline examples. However, it does show a plot that represents the relationship between test accuracy and IPC for the two methods being discussed. The plot is a line graph with the x-axis labeled as "Image Per Class (IPC)" and the y-axis as "Test Accuracy (%)". The lines on the graph are color-coded and have markers at various points to indicate the performance at different IPC values and GPU memory capacities.

The most relevant words from the text on the slide are: Achieved, performances, paper, graph, line, accuracy, test, image, per, class, IPC, NCFAM, DATMA, speedup, seconds, iteration, GPU, memory, sizes, and line graph.

The formula present in the table is not a mathematical formula but rather a representation of speedup. It is written as "Speedup (second / iteration)" and shows the number of seconds it takes for each method to complete an iteration at different levels of IPC.
