1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Multimodal Reasoning" and discusses the concept of Visual-Prompt Generators (VPG) in the context of Multimodal Language Models (MLLMs). The slide is divided into three sections, each representing a different type of MLLM: one that focuses on a single image, one with few-shot ability, and one with text-to-image reference. Each section includes a diagram illustrating the flow of information within the model, with arrows indicating the direction of data processing. The diagrams show how text and image inputs are embedded and processed by the LLM and VPG components of the model. The slide also includes a source citation for the information presented.
