1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, and describe the formula as thorough as possible.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>The slide is titled "Non-Deterministic Search" and features a cartoon illustration of an astronaut standing on the edge of a cliff, looking down at a fire below. The astronaut appears to be in a state of panic, with sweat on his forehead and a worried expression on his face. The fire is depicted in bright orange and yellow colors, indicating its intensity. The slide does not contain any written content, formulas or inline examples.

The illustration seems to be a metaphor for the concept of non-deterministic search in artificial intelligence. In this context, the astronaut represents an AI system, and the cliff and fire represent the complexity and unpredictability of the problem space that the AI system is trying to navigate. The fact that the astronaut is unable to predict the outcome of his next move (whether he will fall into the fire or not) illustrates the non-predictable nature of the search process in AI.

The keywords that are most relevant to this slide are: Non-determinism, Search, AI, Astronaut, Cliff, Fire, Complexity, Unpredictability, Metaphor, Problem Space, Outcome.

The plot of the slide is a visual representation of the challenges faced by AI systems in navigating complex and unpredictable problem spaces. The use of the astronaut as a metaphor adds a human element to the concept, making it more relatable and easier to understand.
