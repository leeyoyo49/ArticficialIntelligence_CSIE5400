<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Denoising Diffusion Models",
  "definitions": {
    "Forward diffusion process": "Introducing noise",
    "Gaussian noise": "In the forward diffusion process, the small Gaussian noise is incrementally added to the distribution over T steps, resulting in a series of increasingly noisy samples."
  },
  "formulas": [
    "q(x_t|x_t-1) = N(x_t; sqrt(1 - beta_t * x_t-1), beta_t * I)"

  "summary": "The slide discusses Denoising Diffusion Models, focusing on the forward diffusion process where Gaussian noise is incrementally added to a distribution over T steps, resulting in increasingly noisy samples. A formula is provided to represent this process."
