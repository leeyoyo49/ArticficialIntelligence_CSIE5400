In the literature, it has been found that the geometric mean of the
BLEU**, scores with n between one and four has the best
correlation with human evaluation, therefore it’s the score more
commonly adopted, called MEAN _BLEU**.

Penalizing short candidate translations

e Consider
¢ R: There is a cat on the mat.
¢ C: There is a cat.
* The scores are: BLEU**,(C) = 4/4 = 1.0 & BLEU**,(C) = 3/3= 1.0

¢ Looks like C achieves a perfect BLEU**, score for each n, even though the
candidate is missing a piece of text with respect to the reference.
