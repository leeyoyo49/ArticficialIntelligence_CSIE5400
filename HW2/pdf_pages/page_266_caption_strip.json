  "summary": "The slide discusses MLLM Pretraining with Event Semantic Structures, focusing on Structured Alignment via Optimal Transport. It defines a cost matrix for embedding similarity and outlines the optimization goal of minimizing transport distance. The slide also includes a diagram of an Image Event Graph and a mathematical formula for the Sinkhorn Knopp algorithm."
