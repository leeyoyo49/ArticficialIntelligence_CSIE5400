   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples
2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.
3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

Our Prompt: Self-generate Exemplars + Knowledge

Your goal is to write Python3 code to solve competitive programming problems. Given a problem, explain the core concepts in it and provide
other relevant problems. Then solve the original problem.

# Problem:
You are given a sequence a_l, a_2, .., a_n. Each element of a is 1 or 2. Find out if an integer k exists so that the following conditions are
met. 1 < k <n-1, and al - a_2... a_k = a_{kt1} .. a_n. If there exist multiple k that satisfy the given condition, print the smallest.

# Instruction:

## Algorithms:
Identify the core concepts or algorithms used to solve the problem.

## Tutorial:
Write a tutorial about these algorithms.

## Example Problems:
Provide three examples of relevant competitive programming problems that involve these algorithms. For each problem, describe the problem,
explain the solution in detail, and then write the correct Python3 code.

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:
- Explanation of the solution:
- Python3 code to solve the problem:
