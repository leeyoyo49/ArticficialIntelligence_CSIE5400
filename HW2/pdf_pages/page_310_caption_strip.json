  "summary": "The slide presents an example of a maze-like problem in a grid world where an agent navigates through a grid. The agent receives small 'living' rewards each step and aims to maximize the sum of rewards. The agent's movement is noisy, with a 80% chance of moving North if there is no wall, and a 10% chance of moving West or East. The agent receives big rewards at the end, which can be good or bad."
