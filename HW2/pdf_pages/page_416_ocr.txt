Regret

 

m Evenif you learn the optimal policy,
you still make mistakes along the way

m Regret is ameasure of your total
mistake cost:

u Difference between all your (expected)
rewards, including youthful suboptimality,
and optimal (expected) rewards

mw Minimizing regret goes beyond
learning to be optimal â€” it requires
optimally learning to be optimal

= For example: random exploration and
exploration functions both end up
optimal, but random exploration has
higher regret
