<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Observations",
  "definitions": {
    "LAION": "A dataset used to train vision-language models, consisting of captions derived from alt HTML tags (Alttext) that often describe only a narrow aspect of the image, neglecting significant visual details."
  },
  "formulas": [],
  "keywords": ["Open-web datasets", "train", "open text-to-image models", "significant issues", "LAION dataset", "alt HTML tags", "Alttext", "vision-language models", "image", "person", "photographer", "appearance", "clothes", "position", "background"],
  "summary": "The slide discusses the limitations of open-web datasets like the LAION dataset used for training vision-language models. These datasets often rely on alt HTML tags (Alttext) for captions, which may not fully describe the visual details of an image, such as the appearance, clothes, position, or background of the person depicted."
