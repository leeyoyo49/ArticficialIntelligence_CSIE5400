= Task: Language Model Self-Improvement (LMSI)

e To improve language models without requiring external
supervision, in an unsupervised training manner

e Two notable LMSI works

* RLCAI (arXiv 2022)         RLCAI employs a model to evaluate which of

* RLAIF (arXiv 2023)          the two answers better adheres to a set of
rules or principles, subsequently creating a
dataset of Al preferences. The system then
trains using reinforcement learning, with the
preference model as the reward signal.
