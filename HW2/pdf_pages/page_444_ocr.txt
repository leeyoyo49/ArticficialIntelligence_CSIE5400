= Computing n-grams precision
e Away to get higher scores for well-formed sentences is to consider
matching 2-grams or 3-grams instead of 1-grams only. Let’s call BLEU**,
the score that considers only 1-grams and BLEU**, the score that
considers only 2-grams.
e Example:
¢ R: There is a cat on the mat.
* C71: There is a cat on the mat.
* C2: Mat the cat is on a there.
* C7 has six 2-grams and they all appear on the reference R, thus:
» BLEU**,(C1) = 7/7 = 1.0 & BLEU**,(C1) = 6/6 = 1.0
¢ Instead, in C2 all the 2-grams don’t appear in the reference, thus:
» BLEU**,(C2) = 7/7 = 1.0 & BLEU**,(C2) = 0/6 = 0.0
