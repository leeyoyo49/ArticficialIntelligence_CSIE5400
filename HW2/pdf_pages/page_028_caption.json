<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json

    "Multi-Head Self-Attention": "Multiple self-attention heads in parallel"
  },

  "summary": "The slide presents the concept of a Multi-Head Self-Attention Layer in artificial intelligence, explaining that it involves multiple self-attention heads operating in parallel. The process includes concatenating outputs from these heads and then splitting the result. The diagram illustrates the structure with multiple heads, each performing self-attention on inputs X0, X1, and X2, and the final output is split into three parts."
