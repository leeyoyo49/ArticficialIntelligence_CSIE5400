<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Challenges in Deep Reinforcement Learning",
  "definitions": {
    "Non-stationary or unstable learning target": "The learning target is continuously changing with each iteration. In deep learning, the target variable does not change and hence the training is stable, which is just not true for reinforcement learning."
  },
  "formulas": [
    "Q(s_t, a_t) <- Q(s_t, a_t) + \u03b1[\u03b7_t+1] + \u03bbmax Q(s_t+1, a) - Q(s_t, a_t)"
  ],
  "keywords": [
    "Deep Reinforcement Learning",
    "Non-stationary",
    "unstable",
    "learning target",
    "deep learning"
  ],
  "summary": "The slide discusses the challenges in deep reinforcement learning, focusing on the non-stationary or unstable learning target. It explains that unlike in deep learning, the target variable in reinforcement learning changes with each iteration, making the training unstable. A formula is presented to illustrate this concept."
