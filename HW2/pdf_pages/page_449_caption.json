<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json

    "Contextual Embeddings": "Reference and candidate sentences are represented using contextual embeddings based on surrounding words, computed by models like BERT, RoBERTa, XLNET, and XLM.",
    "Pairwise Cosine Similarity": "A measure of similarity between two vectors that is based on the cosine of the angle between them.",

  "summary": "The slide presents the BERTScore Architecture, explaining how it uses contextual embeddings from models like BERT, RoBERTa, XLNET, and XLM to represent sentences. It details the process of calculating pairwise cosine similarity between reference and candidate sentences, identifying the maximum similarity, and optionally applying importance weighting to adjust the scores."
