<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Multimodal CoT Reasoning",
  "definitions": {
    "CoT": "Chain of Thought",
    "Reasoning": "Process of forming a judgment or decision",
    "Accuracy": "Correctness of a measurement or calculation"
  },
  "formulas": [

  "keywords": [
    "Multimodal",
    "CoT",
    "Reasoning",

    "Example"
  ],
  "summary": "The slide discusses the impact of rationales on answer prediction in multimodal CoT reasoning. It provides an example where the No-CoT method predicts the answer directly, while the Reasoning method conditions the answer inference to the rationale. The accuracy of the No-CoT method is 81.63%, and the Reasoning method is 69.32%, showing a significant drop in accuracy when using the latter."
