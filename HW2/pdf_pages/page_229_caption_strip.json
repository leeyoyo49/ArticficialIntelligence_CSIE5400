  "summary": "The slide discusses 'Multimodal CoT Reasoning' and focuses on 'Error Analysis'. It explains that the most common errors in models are commonsense mistakes, which make up 80% of errors. These errors occur when models are asked questions requiring commonsense knowledge, such as interpreting maps, counting objects in images, or using the alphabet. A pie chart illustrates that 80% of errors are commonsense mistakes, 14% are logical, and 6% are others."
