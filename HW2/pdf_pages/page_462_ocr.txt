Reinforcement learning is an Al area concerned with how an intelligent agent ought to take
actions in a dynamic environment in order to maximize the cumulative reward.

Different from supervised learning in not needing labelled input/output pairs to be presented,
reinforcement learning focuses on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted
territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge) with the goal of maximizing the long term

reward.
