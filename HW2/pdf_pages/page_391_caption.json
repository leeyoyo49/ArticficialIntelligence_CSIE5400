<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Model-Based Learning",
  "definitions": {
    "Model-Based Idea": "Learn an approximate model based on experiences",
    "Solve for values": "Solve for values as if the learned model were correct"
  },
  "formulas": [

  "keywords": [
    "Model-Based Learning",

    "Normalize",

  ],
  "summary": "The slide discusses the concept of Model-Based Learning, which involves learning an approximate model based on experiences and solving for values as if the model were correct. It outlines two steps: learning an empirical MDP model by counting outcomes and normalizing them, and solving the learned MDP, possibly using value iteration."
