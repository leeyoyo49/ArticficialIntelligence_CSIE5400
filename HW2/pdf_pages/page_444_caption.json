<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json

  "summary": "The slide discusses the BLEU metric for evaluating the quality of text by considering 1-grams and 2-grams. It provides an example of how BLEU scores are computed for two sentences, C1 and C2, using the reference sentence R. The example shows that C1 has a BLEU score of 1.0 for both 1-grams and 2-grams, while C2 has a BLEU score of 1.0 for 1-grams but 0.0 for 2-grams."
