<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "The Transformer Encoder Block (4/5)",
  "definitions": {
    "Transformer encoder": "A component of the Transformer model that processes input data to generate a continuous representation.",
    "Multi-head self-attention": "A mechanism in the Transformer model that allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.",
    "Positional encoding": "A method used in the Transformer model to give the model information about the position of the words in the sentence."
  },
  "formulas": [
    "Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / sqrt(d_k) * V"

  "keywords": [

    "Multi-head self-attention",
    "Positional encoding",
    "Attention mechanism"
  ],
  "summary": "The slide presents the Transformer Encoder Block, a part of the Transformer model. It explains the role of the Transformer encoder, the concept of multi-head self-attention, and the use of positional encoding. The slide also includes a formula for the attention mechanism."
