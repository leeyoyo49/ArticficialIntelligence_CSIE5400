= BertScore is a method used to measure the quality of text
summarization. This method measures how similar the text
summary is to the original text.

=m BertScore addresses two common issues that n-gram-based
metrics often encounter.

e First, n-gram models tend to incorrectly match paraphrases because
semantically accurate expressions may differ from the surface form of the
reference text, which can lead to incorrect performance estimation.

e Second, n-gram models cannot capture long-range dependencies and
penalize semantically significant reordering.
