<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "What is Markov about MDPs?",
  "definitions": {
    "Markov": "generally means that given the present state, the future and the past are independent",
    "Markov decision processes": "means action outcomes depend only on the current state"
  },
  "formulas": [
    "P(St+1 = s' | St = st, At = a_t, St-1 = st-1, At-1, ..., S0 = s0) = P(St+1 = s' | St = st, At = a_t)",
    "P(St+1 = s' | St = st, At = a_t)"
  ],
  "keywords": [
    "Markov",
    "MDPs",
    "decision processes",
    "action outcomes",
    "current state"
  ],
  "summary": "The slide explains Markov's concept in the context of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), emphasizing that action outcomes depend solely on the current state, similar to search algorithms where the successor function depends only on the current state, not the history."
