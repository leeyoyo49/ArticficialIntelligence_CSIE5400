  "summary": "The slide presents the concept of Policy Iteration in reinforcement learning, where an agent iteratively improves its policy to maximize the expected return. It includes a formula for calculating the value function V(s) based on the current policy \pi(a|s), the reward function R(s, a), and the discount factor \gamma."
