<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json

  "title": "Adversarial Distribution Matching",
  "definitions": {
    "adversarial": "A novel approach that reformulates distribution matching as an adversarial minimax optimization problem.",
    "minimax": "A framework that seeks the optimal synthetic data distribution D~ that minimizes L while network ψ maximizes L to establish a robust metric."

  "keywords": [

  "summary": "The slide discusses a novel approach to distribution matching by reformulating it as an adversarial minimax optimization problem. It involves maximizing a discrepancy measure to define a robust metric, parameterized by a neural network, and minimizing the discrepancy between synthetic and real datasets by optimizing the synthetic data distribution. The formal expression of this optimization problem is given as 'min max L(D~, D, f, ψ)'."
