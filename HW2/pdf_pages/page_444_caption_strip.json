  "summary": "The slide discusses the BLEU metric for evaluating the quality of text by considering 1-grams and 2-grams. It provides an example of how BLEU scores are computed for two sentences, C1 and C2, using the reference sentence R. The example shows that C1 has a BLEU score of 1.0 for both 1-grams and 2-grams, while C2 has a BLEU score of 1.0 for 1-grams but 0.0 for 2-grams."
