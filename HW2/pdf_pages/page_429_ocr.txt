= Target Network

e Since the same network is calculating the predicted value and the target
value, there could be a lot of divergence between these two. So, instead of
using one neural network for learning, we can use two.

e We could use a separate network to estimate the target. This target
network has the same architecture as the function approximator but with
frozen parameters. For every C iterations (a hyperparameter), the
parameters from the prediction network are copied to the target network.

e This leads to more stable training because it keeps the target function fixed
(for a while).
