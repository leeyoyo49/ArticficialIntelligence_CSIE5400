<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Computing Time-Limited Values",
  "definitions": {
    "V0": "Initial value",
    "V1": "First value",
    "V2": "Second value",
    "V3": "Third value",
    "V4": "Fourth value"

  ],
  "summary": "The slide presents a method for computing time-limited values using a series of initial values. The process involves adding the initial values to compute the final value, represented by V4. The slide includes a visual representation of the computation process, with arrows indicating the flow of values and a diagram showing the progression of values over time."
