Feature-Based Representations

 

m Solution: describe a state using a vector of
features (properties) f;, fa, ...
= Features are functions from states to real numbers
(often 0/1) that capture important properties of the
state
m= Example features:
m Distance to closest ghost
= Distance to closest dot
= Number of ghosts
m 1/ (dist to dot)2
= Is Pacman in a tunnel? (0/1)
m Canalso describe a q-state (s, a) with features (e.g.
action moves closer to food)
