¢ Initialization
‧ The Actor produces a trajectory tT, by interacting with the
environment.
‧ The Evaluator then produces a score rg which is computed as tT; =
M.(T.), where tT; is only a scalar reward for trial t.
¢ The Self-Reflection model analyzes the set of {t), 79} to produce a
summary sro which is stored in the memory mem, where sy; is a
verbal experience feedback for trial t.
‧ Repeat
¢ The Actor, Evaluator, and Self-Reflection model work together
through trials in a loop until the Evaluator deems sr; to be correct.
Note that after each trial t, sr;,, is appended mem.
