with Transformer Based Models

¢ Input: Sequence x,, ..., X7
¢ Output: Sequence yj, ..., yr

¢ Transformer is an encoder-decoder architecture:
‧ An encoder (neural network) analyzes the input and builds an
intermediate representation (a.k.a. context vector) of it;
¢ Adecoder (neural network) analyzes the intermediate
representation and creates an output.
