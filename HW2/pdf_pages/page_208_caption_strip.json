  "summary": "The slide presents two examples of reasoning problems related to artificial intelligence. The first example involves counting objects after subtracting specific types, while the second example calculates the shear modulus of an acetal polymer block using given dimensions and applied force. Both examples include step-by-step reasoning and conclusion stages."
