<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Exponential Moving Average",
  "definitions": {
    "Traditional Average": "AVG(x) = 1/N Σ xn",
    "Exponential Moving Average": "xn = (1 - α) * xn-1 + α * xn"
  },
  "formulas": [
    "AVG(x) = 1/N Σ xn",
    "xn = (1 - α) * xn-1 + α * xn",
    "xn = xn + (1 - α) * xn-1 + (1 - α)^2 * xn-2 + ..."
  ],
  "keywords": [
    "Exponential Moving Average",
    "Traditional Average",
    "Running Interpolation Update",
    "Recent Samples",
    "Past Samples"
  ],
  "summary": "The slide compares the Traditional Average and Exponential Moving Average methods. The Traditional Average requires all N samples at once and cannot be streamed, while the Exponential Moving Average updates with a running interpolation and gives more importance to recent samples, but forgets about past samples."
