  "summary": "The slide discusses the impact of rationales on answer prediction in multimodal CoT reasoning. It provides an example where the No-CoT method predicts the answer directly, while the Reasoning method conditions the answer inference to the rationale. The accuracy of the No-CoT method is 81.63%, and the Reasoning method is 69.32%, showing a significant drop in accuracy when using the latter."
