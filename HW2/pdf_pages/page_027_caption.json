<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Self-Attention Layer",
  "definitions": {
    "Permutation equivariant": "A property of a function where the function's output is invariant under permutations of the input."
  },
  "formulas": [
    "The self-attention layer does not care about the order of the inputs."
  ],
  "keywords": [
    "Self-Attention Layer",
    "Permutation equivariant",
    "Positional encoding",
    "Inputs",
    "Outputs"
  ],
  "summary": "The slide discusses the self-attention layer in the context of permutation equivariance, highlighting that it does not consider the order of inputs. It introduces the problem of encoding ordered sequences like language or spatially ordered image features, and suggests the need for positional encoding to address this issue."
