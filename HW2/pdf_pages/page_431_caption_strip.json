  "summary": "The slide discusses a technique called 'Experience Replay' used in Q-learning to handle constantly changing inputs and outputs. It explains that instead of running Q-learning on state/action pairs as they occur, the data is replayed. An example is given of building a video game bot, where each frame of the game represents a different state, and a random batch of frames is sampled during training."
