iY   Key Idea: Derive the Final Answer through
和

  

A pioneering study utilized natural language rationales to solve
math problems by ... “derive the final answer through a series of

small steps.          Probe:

Question: Two trains running in opposite directions cross a
man standing on the platform in 27 seconds and 17 seconds
respectively and they cross each other in 23 seconds. The ratio

In this study, a model is        of their speeds is:

proposed to jointly learn
to generate the text in
the rationale, and to

Rationale: Let the speeds of the two trains be x m/sec and y
m/sec respectively. Then, length of the first train = 27x meters,
perform the math                 and length of the second train = 17 y meters. (27x + 17y)/(x +
operations required to         y) = 23 > 27x + 17y =23x + 23y 一> 4X 三 6y 一 x/y = 3/2.

solve the problem.              orrect Option: 5
