<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json

    "Transformer": "an encoder-decoder architecture",
    "Encoder": "a neural network that analyzes the input and builds an intermediate representation (a.k.a. context vector) of it",
    "Decoder": "a neural network that analyzes the intermediate representation and creates an output"

  "summary": "The slide explains the process of sequence to sequence generation using transformer-based models. It details the input and output sequences, the encoder-decoder architecture, and the roles of the encoder and decoder in the process. A diagram illustrates the flow from input to output through the encoder and decoder."
