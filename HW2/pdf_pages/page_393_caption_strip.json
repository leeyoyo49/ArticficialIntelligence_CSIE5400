  "title": "Analogy: Expected Age",
  "summary": "The slide presents an analogy to compute the expected age of current students in NTU CSIE using known and unknown probabilities of age. It explains the concept of expected value and how it can be calculated with and without the probability distribution.",
  "definitions": {
    "Expected Value": "The expected value of a random variable is the long-run average value of repetitions of the same experiment.",
    "Probability": "The probability of an event is a measure of the likelihood that the event will occur."
