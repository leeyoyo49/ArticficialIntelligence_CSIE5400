<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Example: Pacman",
  "definitions": {
    "naive q-learning": "In naive q-learning, we know nothing about this state:"
  },
  "formulas": [
    "Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + \alpha [R + \gamma \max_a Q(s',a) - Q(s,a)]"
  ],
  "keywords": [
    "Pacman",
    "naive q-learning",
    "state",
    "experience",
    "learning"
  ],
  "summary": "The slide provides an example of naive q-learning in the context of the Pacman game. It illustrates the concept by showing two states of the game, one where the player has discovered the state is bad and another where the player has no knowledge about the state. The slide also includes a formula for updating the Q-value in naive q-learning."
