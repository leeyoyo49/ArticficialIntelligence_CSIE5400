    "Q-learning": "A type of reinforcement learning algorithm that seeks to find a policy that maximizes the sum of all future rewards. It does this by learning a value function that estimates the value of each state-action pair."

    "Q(st, at) <- Q(st, at) + α[rt+1 + ηmax Q(st+1, a) - Q(st, at)]"

  "summary": "The slide discusses the simplification of the Q-learning algorithm by replacing the Q-table with a neural network. It includes a formula for updating the Q-value and explains the removal of the learning rate, which allows for the elimination of two Q(st, a) terms."
