  "summary": "The RECAP Framework proposes relabeling the corpus with improved captions auto-generated by a custom I2T model to increase sample efficiency and enhance the understanding of relations between captions and images. The process involves fine-tuning an image-to-text captioning model on manually annotated images, using this model to recaption images in a training dataset, and then training an image generation model with the recaptioned dataset."
