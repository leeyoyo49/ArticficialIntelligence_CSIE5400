sample-Based Policy Evaluation?
m We want to improve our estimate of V by computing these averages:
Ve1(s) — a T(s,7(s), s’)[R(s, 7(s), 8°) + Vi (s')]
m idea: Take samples of outcomes s’ (by doing the action!) and average

sample; = R(s,7(s), 51 ) 十 Ve (81)
sampleng = R(s,7(s), 85) + Vik (89)

samplen = R(s,7(s), Sn) i VE (Sp)

Unfortunately, “n samples” here are not always available!
