Reinforcement Learning: Overview

 

m Passive Reinforcement Leaming: how to learn from already given experiences
= Model-based: learn the MDP model from experiences, then solve the MDP
= Model-free: forego learning the MDP model, directly learn V or Q
= Value learning: learns value of a fixed policy
m 2 approaches: Direct Evaluation & TD Learning
= Qlearning: learns Q values of the optimal policy (Q version of TD Learning)

= Active Reinforcement Leaming: how to collect new experiences

ms Approximate Reinforcement Leaming: to handle large state spaces
