<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json

    "Actor": "produces a trajectory \u03c00 by interacting with the environment",
    "Evaluator": "produces a score r0 which is computed as \u03c0t = Me(\u03c00), where \u03c0t is only a scalar reward for trial t",
    "Self-Reflection model": "analyzes the set of { \u03c00, r0 } to produce a summary sr0 which is stored in the memory mem, where sr_t is a verbal experience feedback for trial t"

  "summary": "The slide explains the Reflexion process, detailing the roles of the Actor, Evaluator, and Self-Reflection model in producing and evaluating a trajectory. The process involves the Actor interacting with the environment, the Evaluator computing a score, and the Self-Reflection model analyzing the set of trajectory and score to produce a summary. This summary is stored in memory and serves as verbal feedback for each trial."
