  "summary": "The slide discusses the concept of 'Hard negatives' in the context of manipulating event structures in images. It provides definitions for 'Event Type', 'Agent', 'Target', and 'Instrument'. It also includes a table with examples of positive and negative labels for different event types, such as 'Transport (carry)' and 'Arrest (arrest)'. The slide is part of a presentation on 'Knowledge-Driven Vision-Language Encoding'."
