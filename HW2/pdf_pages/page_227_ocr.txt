Problem

Question: Which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles?

Context: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each yellow ball represents one particle of solute.

 

 

 

 (B) Solution A |

 

Options: | (A) Solution B

Gold Rationale: In Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To figure out which
solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, look at both the number of yellow particles and the volume
of the solvent in each container. Use the concentration formula to find the number of yellow particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more yellow particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of yellow particles.

 

Answer: The answer is (A).

Baseline

Rationale: In Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent
the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of
yellow particles, look at both the number of yellow particles and the

volume of the solvent in each container. Use the concentration formula
to find the number of yellow particles per milliliter. Solution A has more
yellow particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration
of yellow particles.

Answer: The answer is (B).

(C) neither; their concentrations are the same
