  "summary": "The slide presents an example of Vision-Language-Action Models (RT-2) for robot control, demonstrating the transfer of web knowledge to robotic control through a process called Co-Fine-Tuning. It includes a diagram showing the flow from 'Transfer Web Knowledge to Robotic Control' to 'Closed-Loop Robot Control' and 'Deploy'. Additionally, it provides a translation and rotation example for a robot's action."
