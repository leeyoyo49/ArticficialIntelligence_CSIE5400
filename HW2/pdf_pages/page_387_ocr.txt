Reinforcement Learning

 

gm Still assume a Markov decision process (MDP):
= Asetof statesseS
= Aset of actions (per state) A
= Amodel T(s,a,s)                        Siate: s
= Areward function R(s,a,s’)             Reward: r

gw Still looking for a policy z(s)
nvironmen

= New twist: don't know Tor R
m i.e. we don’t know which states are good or what the actions do
= Must actually try out actions and states to learn
