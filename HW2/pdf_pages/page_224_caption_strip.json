  "summary": "The slide presents the concept of Multimodal CoT Reasoning, a mechanism that integrates text and image modalities into a two-stage framework. The first stage involves rationale generation, and the second stage involves answer inference. Both stages share the same model structure but differ in input and output. The slide also includes a visual representation of the process and a question-answer example."
