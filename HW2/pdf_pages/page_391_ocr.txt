Model-Based Learning

 

m= Model-Based Idea:
m Leam an approximate model based on experiences
m Solve for values as if the learned model were correct

m Step 1: Leam empirical MDP model
= Count outcomes s’ for each s, a
= Normalize to give an estimate of T'(s, a, s’)
m Discover each R(s, a, s’) when we experience (s, a, s’)

 

m Step 2: Solve the learned MDP

= For example, use value iteration, as before
