。「上irstly, we allocate a unique image proxy (IMGijj) to reference
the visual embedding of image j, which provides a unique
identifier for MLLMs to index and distinguish between visual
and text embeddings.

¢ Then, we utilize natural language prompts to establish
references between text and image.

¢ Incorporating the explicit text-to-image reference in the image
declaration assists the model in correlating the text with the
appropriate image.
