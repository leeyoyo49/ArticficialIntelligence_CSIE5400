Multimodal CoT Reasoning

Question: Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the

following statements is true?

Context: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do

not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.

 

Options:   |  (A) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.

 

 

(B) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.

 

 

|  (C) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.

 

Gold Rationale: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of
the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Both magnet sizes and distance affect the magnitude of the magnetic
force. The sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2. The distance between the magnets is also the same. So, the magnitude of the

magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
Answer: The answer is (C).

Baseline

Rationale: Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force.
When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of
the magnetic force between them is smaller. There is a greater
distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the
magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.
Answer: The answer is (B).

Rationale: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel.
But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of
the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic
force. Both magnet sizes and distance affect the magnitude of the
magnetic force. The sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in
Pair 2. The distance between the magnets is also the same. So, the
magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.

Answer: The answer is (C).
