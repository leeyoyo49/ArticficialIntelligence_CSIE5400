Exponential Moving Average

 

a Traditional Average: ava(x) ==Yy xn

m Need to have all N samples at once (cannot “stream” in samples)

= Exponential moving average
gw Therunning interpolation update: Zz, = (1 —a)-Z%n_1 +Q-2n        O0<a<1

m Makes recent samples more important:
In + (1—a):a%p_1+(1—a@)?-apn_o4+...

1+(1-—a)+(1-a)*+...
= Forgets about the past samples (how quickly depends on a)
