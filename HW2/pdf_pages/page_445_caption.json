<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "BLEU (3/4)",
  "definitions": {
    "BLEU": "In the literature, it has been found that the geometric mean of the BLEU* scores with n between one and four has the best correlation with human evaluation, therefore it's the score more commonly adopted, called MEAN_BLEU**."
  },
  "formulas": [
    "BLEU**1(C) = 4/4 = 1.0",
    "BLEU**2(C) = 3/3 = 1.0"
  ],
  "keywords": [
    "BLEU",
    "geometric mean",
    "human evaluation",
    "MEAN_BLEU",
    "candidate translations"
  ],
  "summary": "The slide discusses the BLEU score, specifically the geometric mean of BLEU* scores, and its correlation with human evaluation. It also introduces the concept of penalizing short candidate translations and provides an example with scores."
