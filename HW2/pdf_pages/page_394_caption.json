<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Model-Free Learning",
  "definitions": {
    "Model-Free Learning": "A type of machine learning where the algorithm learns to make decisions based on the current state and the reward received, without building a model of the environment."
  },
  "formulas": [
    "Q-learning formula: Q(s, a) = Q(s, a) + alpha * (reward + gamma * max(Q(s', a)) - Q(s, a))"
  ],
  "keywords": [
    "Model-Free Learning",
    "machine learning",
    "algorithm",
    "state",
    "reward"
  ],
  "summary": "The slide presents the concept of Model-Free Learning, a machine learning approach where decisions are made based on the current state and received rewards, without constructing a predictive model of the environment. It includes the Q-learning formula, which is central to this learning method."
