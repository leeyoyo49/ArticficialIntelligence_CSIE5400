Distribution Matching (DM)

¢ Among various methods, distribution matching (DM) based
approaches stand out for their balance of computational efficiency
and strong performance.

¢ A key challenge in DM lies in defining an effective metric to measure
distributional discrepancies between real and synthetic datasets.
