1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples
2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.
3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.
4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
