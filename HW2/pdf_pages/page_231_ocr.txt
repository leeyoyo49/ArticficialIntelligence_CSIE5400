Question: Complete the text to describe the diagram. Solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable

membrane. But more solute particles moved across the membrane (). When there was an equal concentration on both sides, -~~""~"  WtON =
the particles reached equilibrium.

Context: The diagram below shows a solution with one solute. Each solute particle is represented by a green ball. The

solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane. The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is

permeable to the solute particles. The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.

Options: (A) to the left than to the right   |  (B) to the right than to the left

Rationale : (extract) It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion. Before the solute particles
reached equilibrium, there were 3 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 5 solute particles on the right side
of the membrane. When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the
membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the left side of the membrane than before. So, for the solute particles to
reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

Answer: The answer is (A).
