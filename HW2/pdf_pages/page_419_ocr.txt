Generalizing Across States

 

m Basic QLearning keeps a table of all q-values

m Inrealistic situations, we cannot possibly learn
about every single state!
= loo many states to visit them all in training
= Too many states to hold the q-tables in memory

m Instead, we want to generalize:
m Leam about some small number of training states from
experience
m Generalize that experience to new, similar situations

m Thisis a fundamental idea in machine learning, and we'll
see it over and over again
