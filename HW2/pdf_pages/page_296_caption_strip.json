  "summary": "The slide discusses the limitations of Mean Squared Error (MSE) in matching methods, which only captures pixel-level or patch-level information without considering the semantic structures in high-dimensional manifolds. It suggests that MSE is not suitable for distribution comparison. A diagram illustrates the concept of minimizing distance within a set Z_R, comparing synthetic and real data."
