<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "The Transformer Decoder Block (4)",
  "definitions": {
    "Multi-head attention": "block is NOT self-attention. It attends over encoder outputs.",
    "Masked Multi-head self-attention": "For image captions, this is how we inject image features into the decoder."
  },
  "formulas": [
    "Multi-head attention",

  ],
  "keywords": [
    "Transformer",
    "Decoder",
    "Multi-head attention",
    "Masked Multi-head self-attention",
    "encoder outputs"
  ],
  "summary": "The slide presents the fourth block of the Transformer Decoder, focusing on the Multi-head attention mechanism. It explains that this block is not self-attention and instead attends over encoder outputs. For image captions, the slide illustrates how image features are injected into the decoder using Masked Multi-head self-attention."
