iY   Potential for Self-Improvement

m We compare two answer generation strategies:

e (1) w/o SE: the answer is a directly deterministic output of the LLM.

e (2) w/ SE: LLM generates an answer and evaluates its correctness. If the
evaluation indicates the answer is incorrect, LLM re-generates an answer
as the final output.
