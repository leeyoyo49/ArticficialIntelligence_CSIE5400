  "summary": "The slide discusses the concept of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Leap-of-Thought (LoT) in the context of Large Language Models (LLLM). CoT is described as a step-by-step reasoning process that is effective for logical tasks but not for creative problem-solving. LoT is presented as a non-sequential, creative paradigm that involves strong associations and knowledge leaps, which is crucial for innovation advancements."
