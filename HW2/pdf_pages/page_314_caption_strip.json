  "summary": "The slide discusses the concept of policies in deterministic single-agent search problems and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). It defines an optimal plan and policy, and explains that an optimal policy maximizes expected utility. It also mentions that an explicit policy defines a reflex agent."
