sample-Based Policy Evaluation?

m We want to improve our estimate of V by computing these averages:
Vigi(s) — SOT, 2(s), 8) [R(s, 7(s), 81) + Vi (89]

s’ However, T is not available!

m Idea: Take samples of outcomes s’ (by doing the action!) and average

sample, = R(s,7(s), s1) + Ve (81)                Known P(A):

samplez = R(s,7(s), 8) + Vi (s9)                     B[A] = $7 Pla) -a

samplen = R(s,7(s), Sn) i VE (Sp)

Unknown P(A): “Model Free”
