<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the ocr of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples
2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.
3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.
4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string

¢ CoT guides MLLM to reason step-by-step, and can motivate their logical
reasoning ability. While effective for logical tasks, CoT is not conducive
to creative problem-solving which often requires out-of-box thoughts and
is crucial for innovation advancements.

¢ CoT is a non-sequential, creative paradigm involving strong associations
and knowledge leaps.
