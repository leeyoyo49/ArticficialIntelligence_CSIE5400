# Relevant exemplars:

Q: What is the area of the square with a side length of 5?

A: The area of a square is found by squaring the length of its
side. So, the area of this square is 542 = 25. ...

# Solve the initial problem:

To find the area of the square, we need to find the side
length. The length is ... \sqrt{(2 - (-2))42 + (-2 - 2)*2} =
\sqrt{32}. So, the area of the square is (\sqrt{32})42 = 32.
