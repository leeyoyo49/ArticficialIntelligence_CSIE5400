<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Any concern on generating intermediate steps instead of direct answers?",
  "definitions": {
    "MLLMs": "probabilistic models of generating next tokens",
    "decoding": "process of generating a sequence of tokens from a model"
  },
  "formulas": [
    "arg max P(reasoning path, final answer|problem)",
    "arg max P(final answer|problem)"
  ],
  "keywords": [
    "concern",
    "intermediate steps",
    "direct answers",
    "MLLMs",
    "probabilistic models"
  ],
  "summary": "The slide discusses the concern of generating intermediate steps in MLLMs and compares the decoding process of MLLMs with the desired outcome. It emphasizes that MLLMs are probabilistic models and not humans, and it presents two formulas related to the decoding process."
