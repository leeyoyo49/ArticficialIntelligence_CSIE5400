  "summary": "The slide discusses the concept of 'Hard negatives' in the context of manipulating event structures in images. It categorizes events into 'Transport (carry)' and 'Arrest (arrest)' and provides labels for different elements in the image such as 'Person', 'Instrument', and 'Bench'. The source of the information is a 'Knowledge-Driven Vision-Language Encoding' tutorial by CVPR, 2023."
