Positional Encoding

 

Concatenate special positional
encoding Pp, to each input vector x

We use a function pos: N ->R°
to process the position j of the
vector into a d-dimensional vector

18                 So, p = pos(j)                                                        Source: “Attention is all you need,” NeurlPS, 2017.
