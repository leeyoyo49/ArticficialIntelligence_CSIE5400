  "summary": "The slide outlines the three-step training procedure of the Reinforcement Learning Classifier (RLC). It involves generating answers to unlabeled questions, self-evaluating the language model using an evaluation prompt, and updating the language model to maximize the reward using reinforcement learning algorithms. The slide also includes a diagram illustrating the data flow and the update process of the language model parameters."
