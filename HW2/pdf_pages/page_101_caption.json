<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Stanford AI Village [JUST 2023] Episodic memory of experience",
  "definitions": {
    "Memory Stream": "The memory stream comprises a large number of observations that are relevant and irrelevant to the agent's current situation. Retrieval identifies a subset of these observations that should be passed to the language model to condition its response to the situation."
  },
  "formulas": [
    "retrieval = recency + importance + relevance"
  ],
  "keywords": [
    "Stanford AI Village",
    "JUST 2023",
    "Episodic memory",
    "Experience",
    "Memory Stream"
  ],
  "summary": "The slide discusses the concept of 'Episodic memory of experience' in the context of AI, specifically how a 'Memory Stream' is used to process observations relevant to an agent's current situation. It also explains the retrieval process and provides a formula for calculating the relevance of observations."
