<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json

  "summary": "The slide discusses the concept of 'Hard negatives' in the context of manipulating event structures in AI. It explains different event types such as 'Transport (carry)' and 'Arrest (arrest)', and introduces the idea of 'Negative Labels (events)' and 'Negative Labels (arguments)'. The slide also mentions 'Role Switching' as a technique used in this process. An image is used to illustrate the concept, and a table is provided to further explain the event types and their associated roles."
