<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Infinite Utilities?!",
  "definitions": {
    "Finite horizon": "similar to depth-limited search"
  },
  "formulas": [
    "Terminate episodes after a fixed T steps (e.g. life)"
  ],
  "keywords": [
    "Problem",
    "game",
    "infinite rewards",
    "finite horizon",
    "depth-limited search",
    "nonstationary policies",
    "time left"
  ],
  "summary": "The slide discusses the problem of infinite rewards in a game that lasts forever and proposes a solution using a finite horizon approach, similar to depth-limited search. It suggests terminating episodes after a fixed number of steps and using nonstationary policies that depend on the time left."
