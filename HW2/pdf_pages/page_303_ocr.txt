Dataset Distillation with NCFM

¢ Real and synthetic data points are sampled and embedded through a feature
extractor network. The synthetic data is optimized by minimizing the
distributional discrepancy between real and synthetic data, measured via the
Neural Characteristic Function Discrepancy (NCFD) in the complex plane.
Additionally, an auxiliary network learns an optimal sampling distribution for the
frequency arguments of the characteristic function.
