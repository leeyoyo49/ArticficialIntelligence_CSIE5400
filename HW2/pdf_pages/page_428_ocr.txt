= Non-stationary or unstable learning target

|
The learning target is continuously changing with
each iteration. In deep learning, the target variable
does not change and hence the training is stable,
which is just not true for reinforcement learning.

= To summarize, we often depend on the policy or value functions in reinforcement
learning to sample actions. However, this is frequently changing as we continuously
learn what to explore. As we play out the game, we get to know more about the

ground truth values of states and actions and hence, the output is also changing.
