<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "How to Explore?",
  "definitions": {
    "random actions": "Every time step, flip a coin",
    "small probability": "act randomly",
    "large probability": "act on current policy"
  },
  "formulas": [
    "With (small) probability ε, act randomly",
    "With (large) probability 1-ε, act on current policy"
  ],
  "keywords": [
    "exploration",
    "random actions",
    "probability",

  ],
  "summary": "The slide discusses several schemes for forcing exploration in AI, focusing on random actions with varying probabilities. It highlights the problems with random actions, such as the potential for thrashing around once learning is done, and suggests solutions like lowering the probability over time or using exploration functions."
