<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Text to Image Generation with Diffusion Based Models",
  "definitions": {
    "Diffusion Process": "If we look at the movement of a single molecule on a very short time scale, it follows a Gaussian distribution. Since the direction of mixing and the opposite direction are the same in a very short time, the opposite direction also follows a Gaussian distribution."
  },
  "formulas": [
    "m_t \sim N(m_t, \sigma^2)"
  ],
  "keywords": [
    "Text to Image Generation",
    "Diffusion Based Models",
    "Diffusion Process",
    "Gaussian Distribution",
    "m_t"
  ],
  "summary": "The slide discusses the diffusion process in the context of text to image generation using diffusion-based models. It explains that the movement of a single molecule on a very short time scale follows a Gaussian distribution, and this applies to both the direction of mixing and its opposite. A formula representing the distribution of 'm_t' is also presented."
