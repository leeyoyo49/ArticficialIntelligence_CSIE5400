ã€Œ Algorithms: The core algorithm for solving this problem is the prefix product algorithm.

| Ht Tutorial: The prefix product algorithm is used to calculate the product of all the elements in a prefix of an array. The algorithm works
| by initializing a variable "prefix" to 1, and then iterating through the array from left to right. At each iteration, the current element is
multiplied with the prefix, and the result is stored in the prefix variable. This way, the prefix variable keeps track of the product of all
the elements in the prefix of the array. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the size of the input array.

## Example Problems:
1. Problem: Given an array of integers, find the product of all the elements in each subarray of size k.

Solution: We can use the prefix product algorithm to solve this problem. We initialize a prefix variable to 1, and then iterate through
the array from left to right. At each iteration, we multiply the current element with the prefix,

def product_of_subarrays(arr, k):
prefix = 1
result = []
for i in range(len(arr)):
prefix = prefix * arr[i]
if i >= k-1:
result. append(prefix)
prefix = prefix // arr[i-k+1]
return result

2. Problem: Given an array of integers, find the longest subarray with a product less than or equal to a given target.
Solution:

3. Problem: Given an array of integers, find the smallest k such that the product of all the elements in the prefix of the array is equal to
the product of all the elements in the suffix of the array.
Solution:
