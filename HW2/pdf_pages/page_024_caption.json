<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Self-Attention Layer",
  "definitions": {
    "Context vectors": "y (shape: N x D)",
    "Input vectors": "x (shape: N x D)"
  },
  "formulas": [
    "y = self-attention(x)"

  "keywords": [
    "Self-Attention Layer",
    "Context vectors",
    "Input vectors",

    "Shape"
  ],
  "summary": "The slide presents the concept of a Self-Attention Layer in AI, explaining that it takes input vectors of shape N x D and produces context vectors of the same shape. The self-attention mechanism is visually represented with a diagram showing the transformation from input vectors to context vectors."
