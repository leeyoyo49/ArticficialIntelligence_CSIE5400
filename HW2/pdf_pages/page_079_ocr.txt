Reflexion uses verbal reinforcement to help agents learn from
prior failings, i.e., converting binary (e.g., success/fail) or scalar
feedback from the environment into verbal feedback in the form
of a textual summary, which is then added as additional context
for the MLLM agent in the next episode.

Reflexion utilizes three distinct models:

¢ Actor: generating text and actions

¢ Evaluator: scoring the outputs produced by the Actor

¢ Self-Reflection model: generating verbal reinforcement cues to
assist the Actor in self-improvement.
