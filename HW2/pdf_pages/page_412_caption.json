<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Exploration vs. Exploitation",
  "definitions": {
    "Exploration": "The process of searching for new knowledge or resources.",
    "Exploitation": "The use of something for one's own advantage, often without regard for others."
  },
  "formulas": [],
  "keywords": ["Exploration", "Exploitation", "Knowledge", "Resources", "Advantage"],
  "summary": "The slide compares two concepts, Exploration and Exploitation, using a visual metaphor of a robot at a crossroads between 'The Usual Place' and 'Grand Opening'. The robot's indecision represents the choice between exploring new possibilities or exploiting existing ones."
