Computing Actions from Values

am Let's imagine we have the optimal values V*(s)
mg It's not obvious!
m Ve need to do amini-expectimax (one step)                                     :

ex
m*(s) = ar max  T     R   :   V*(s'  max (0.5, 1.7, 1.2] = 1.7
(s) = arg   x (s,a,s')[R(s,a, 8â€˜) + yV*(s')]  Oey ant

 

m This is called policy extraction, since it gets the policy implied by the values
