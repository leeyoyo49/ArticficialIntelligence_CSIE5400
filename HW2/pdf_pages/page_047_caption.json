<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Example: Stable Diffusion",
  "definitions": {
    "Pixel Space": "The space where individual pixels are represented and processed.",
    "Latent Space": "A compressed representation of data, often used in machine learning to reduce dimensionality.",
    "Diffusion Process": "A method of generating data by gradually adding noise to a signal.",
    "Denoising U-Net": "A type of neural network used for noise reduction in images.",
    "Semantic Map": "A representation of the scene or object in a machine learning context.",
    "Text": "Input text used to guide the generation process.",
    "Representations": "The output of the model, often in the form of images or other data.",
    "Images": "The final output of the model, visual representations of the input text and semantic map."

  "summary": "The slide provides an overview of the Stable Diffusion process, illustrating the flow from pixel space to latent space, through a diffusion process, and back to pixel space. It highlights the role of a denoising U-Net in reducing noise and the use of semantic maps and text to guide the generation of representations and images."
