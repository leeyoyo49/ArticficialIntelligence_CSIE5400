= Computing unigrams precision
e To count how many words in a candidate text C are present in the
reference text R, and divide the result by the number of words in C to get a
percentage.
* Therefore, a perfect score is 1.0, whereas the worst score is 0.0.
e Example:
‧ R: The cat is on the mat.
¢ C: The cat and the dog.
¢ In C, there are three words (“the”, “cat”, “the”) that appear on the reference R, thus:
BLEU*(C) = 3/5 = 0.6
e The problem with repeating unigrams
* Consider C: “The The The The The”, BLEU*(C) = 5/5 = 1!
