Infinite Utilities?!

 

mg Problem: What if the game lasts forever? Do we get infinite rewards?

m Solutions:
m Finite horizon: (similar to depth-limited search)
= Terminate episodes after a fixed T steps (e.g. life)
m Gives nonstationary policies (7depends on time left)

 

m Discounting: use 0 <y <1
CO
U(Iro,.-- Tool) = S- y'rt < Rmax/(1 — 7)
t=0
= Smaller y means smaller “horizon” — shorter term focus

m Absorbing state: guarantee that for every policy, a terminal state will eventually
be reached (like “overheated” for racing)
