<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Artificial Intelligence",
  "definitions": {
    "shear modulus": "A measure of a material's ability to resist shear stress, defined as the ratio of shear stress to shear strain."
  },
  "formulas": [
    "Shear modulus (G) = Shear stress (F) / Shear strain (gamma)",
    "Shear modulus (G) = Applied force (F) / (Area of block's top surface (A) * Shear strain (gamma))"
  ],
  "keywords": [
    "shear modulus",
    "applied force",
    "shear stress",
    "shear strain",
    "acetal polymer block"
  ],
  "summary": "The slide presents two examples of reasoning problems related to artificial intelligence. The first example involves counting objects after subtracting specific types, while the second example calculates the shear modulus of an acetal polymer block using given dimensions and applied force. Both examples include step-by-step reasoning and conclusion stages."
