<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Multimodal CoT Reasoning",
  "definitions": {
    "Error Analysis": "The most prevalent error type is commonsense mistakes, accounting for 80% of the errors. These mistakes occur when the model is faced with questions that require commonsense knowledge, such as interpreting maps, counting objects in images, or utilizing the alphabet."
  },
  "formulas": [],
  "keywords": ["Multimodal", "CoT", "Reasoning", "Error Analysis", "Commonsense"],
  "summary": "The slide discusses 'Multimodal CoT Reasoning' and focuses on 'Error Analysis'. It explains that the most common errors in models are commonsense mistakes, which make up 80% of errors. These errors occur when models are asked questions requiring commonsense knowledge, such as interpreting maps, counting objects in images, or using the alphabet. A pie chart illustrates that 80% of errors are commonsense mistakes, 14% are logical, and 6% are others."
