  "summary": "The slide presents the BERTScore architecture, focusing on the importance weighting step. It explains how the importance of rare words is considered using Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), which can be incorporated into BERTScore equations. The slide also includes a visual representation of the process and a formula for calculating the BERTScore."
