Example: Grid World

 

mw Amazeike problem
m= Theagentlives in agrid
mu Walls block the agent's path

m Noisy movement: actions do not always go as planned
= 80% of the time, the action North takes the agent North

(if there is no wall there)
10% of the time, North takes the agent West; 10% East

If there is a wall in the direction the agent would have
been taken, the agent stays put

 

m= Theagent receives rewards each time step
= Small “living” reward each step (can be negative)
= Bigrewards come at the end (good or bad)

= Goal: maximize sum of rewards
