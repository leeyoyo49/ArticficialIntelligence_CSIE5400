    "BLEU": "In the literature, it has been found that the geometric mean of the BLEU* scores with n between one and four has the best correlation with human evaluation, therefore it's the score more commonly adopted, called MEAN_BLEU**."

    "BLEU**1(C) = 4/4 = 1.0",

  "summary": "The slide discusses the BLEU score, specifically the geometric mean of BLEU* scores, and its correlation with human evaluation. It also introduces the concept of penalizing short candidate translations and provides an example with scores."
