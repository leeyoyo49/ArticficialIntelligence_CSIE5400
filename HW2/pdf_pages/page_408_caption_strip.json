  "summary": "The slide presents the Q-Learning algorithm, a sample-based Q-value iteration method. It explains the process of learning Q(s,a) values as you go, which includes receiving a sample, considering old and new estimates, and incorporating the new estimate into a running average. A visual representation of Q-values after 1000 episodes is also shown."
