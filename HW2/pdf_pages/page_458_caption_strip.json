  "summary": "The slide discusses the role of LLM M in reinforcement learning, where it acts as a policy mapping from state space to probability space over action space. The objective is to train the policy to maximize the expected return, which is represented by a mathematical formula. The LLM M can be updated using any RL algorithm to maximize the reward, with the evaluation reward being a key component in this process."
