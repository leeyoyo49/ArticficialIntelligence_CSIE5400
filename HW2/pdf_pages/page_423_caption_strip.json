  "summary": "The slide discusses Deep Q-Learning, a technique that merges Q-Learning with deep neural networks. It explains the rationale behind Deep Q-Learning by illustrating a scenario with 10,000 states and 1,000 actions per state, resulting in a table of 10 million cells. The slide also includes a diagram showing the relationship between state, action, and Q-Value in Q-Learning."
