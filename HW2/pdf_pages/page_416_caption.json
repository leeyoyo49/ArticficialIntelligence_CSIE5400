<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Regret",
  "definitions": {
    "Regret": "a measure of your total mistake cost: Difference between all your (expected) rewards, including youthful suboptimality, and optimal (expected) rewards"
  },
  "formulas": [
    "Regret = Total Mistake Cost"
  ],
  "keywords": [
    "optimal policy",
    "mistake cost",
    "expected rewards",
    "suboptimality",
    "optimal learning"
  ],
  "summary": "The slide discusses the concept of regret in the context of learning and decision-making. It explains that even with an optimal policy, mistakes are inevitable and regret is a measure of the total mistake cost. It also highlights that minimizing regret requires optimal learning, not just optimal learning. An example is given that random exploration and exploration functions both can be optimal, but random exploration has higher regret."
