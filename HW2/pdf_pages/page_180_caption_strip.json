  "summary": "The slide presents a study on probing 'Visible' physical commonsense knowledge, focusing on color, size, and spatial understanding. It includes a table comparing the performance of different models (BERT_large, RoBERTa_large, UnifiedQA_large, VisualBERT) and humans on zero-shot results across tasks. The concept of Relaxed Accuracy (R-Acc) is defined and explained."
