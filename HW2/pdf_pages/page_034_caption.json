<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Masked Self-Attention Layer",
  "definitions": {
    "Attention": "A mechanism in neural networks that selectively focuses on certain parts of the input data.",
    "Alignment": "A matrix that represents the alignment between input and output sequences in attention mechanisms."
  },
  "formulas": [
    "y0 = mul(-> + add(1))",
    "softmax"
  ],
  "keywords": [
    "Attention",
    "Masked Self-Attention",
    "Vectors",
    "Alignment",
    "Neural Networks"
  ],
  "summary": "The slide presents the concept of a Masked Self-Attention Layer in neural networks, which prevents vectors from looking at future vectors and sets future alignment scores to -infinity. It includes a diagram illustrating the process and a formula for calculating the output."
