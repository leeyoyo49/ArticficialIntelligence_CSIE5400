<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Training DQNs",
  "definitions": {
    "Q-learning": "A type of reinforcement learning algorithm that seeks to find a policy that maximizes the sum of all future rewards. It does this by learning a value function that estimates the value of each state-action pair."
  },
  "formulas": [
    "Q(st, at) <- Q(st, at) + \u03b1[rt+1 + \u03b7max Q(st+1, a) - Q(st, at)]"
  ],
  "keywords": [
    "neural network",
    "Q-learning algorithm",
    "Q-table",
    "back-propagating optimizer",
    "learning rate"
  ],
  "summary": "The slide discusses the simplification of the Q-learning algorithm by replacing the Q-table with a neural network. It includes a formula for updating the Q-value and explains the removal of the learning rate, which allows for the elimination of two Q(st, a) terms."
