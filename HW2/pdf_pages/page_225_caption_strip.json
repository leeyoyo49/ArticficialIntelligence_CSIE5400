  "summary": "The slide presents two paradigms for achieving multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning in AI models. The first paradigm involves using a caption model to generate a caption from an image, which is then used as prompted text for an LLM to produce an answer. The second paradigm uses a model to generate a rationale, which is then used as prompted text for another model to produce an answer."
