<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json

  "title": "MDP Search Trees",
  "definitions": {
    "MDP": "A Markov Decision Process, a framework for decision-making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision-maker.",
    "expectimax": "A decision-making algorithm that is used in game theory and artificial intelligence to determine the best move in a game.",
    "state": "A condition or situation that exists at a particular time, especially one that is determined by the past history of the system.",
    "transition": "A change of state that occurs as a result of an action.",
    "T(s,a,s')": "The probability of transitioning from state s to state s' by taking action a.",
    "R(s,a,s')": "The reward received after transitioning from state s to state s' by taking action a."

  "summary": "The slide presents the concept of MDP Search Trees, explaining that each MDP state projects an expectimax-like search tree. It defines MDP and expectimax, and introduces the terms state, transition, and the formulas for transition probability and reward."
