How to Explore?

 

m Several schemes for forcing exploration

m Simplest: random actions (e-greedy)
m Every time step, flip acoin
= With (small) probability <, act randomly
= With (large) probability 1-e, act on current policy

= Problems with random actions?

= You do eventually explore the space, but keep
thrashing around once learning is done

= One solution: lower e over time
= Another solution: exploration functions
