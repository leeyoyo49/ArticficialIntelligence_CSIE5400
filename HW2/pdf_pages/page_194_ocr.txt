Analogical Prompting

The inspiration comes from analogical reasoning in
psychology, a concept where humans draw from relevant past
experiences to tackle new problems.

For instance, when faced with a new math problem, humans
often think about “do | know a related problem?” and recall how
they solved related problems in the past to derive insights for
solving the new problem.
