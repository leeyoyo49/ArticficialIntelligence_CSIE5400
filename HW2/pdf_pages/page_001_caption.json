<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”
1. Extract every piece of written content: slide title, sub-bullets and their full text, definitions, formulas, and any inline examples.
2. Generate a summary of at least 300 words, as thorough and precise as possible, for retrieval and generation.
3. Select at least 5 of the most relevant keywords from the slide.
4. If the slide shows a plot, include a description of the plot.
5. If the slide contains a formula, save it in LaTeX format, but need to be readable in the JSON output.
5. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "summary": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "formulas": [ string ]
   }
6. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string, with no extra text or formatting.<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>I'm a student learning artificial intelligence, teach me every thing in this slide.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>{"title": "Preliminaries and AI Agent Basics", "author": "Wen-Huang Cheng", "affiliation": "National Taiwan University", "email": "wenhuang@csie.ntu.edu.tw", "content": "The slide provides an introduction to Artificial Intelligence, focusing on preliminaries and the basics of AI agents.
