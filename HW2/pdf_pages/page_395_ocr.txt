Direct Evaluation

 

m Goal: Compute values for each state under zz

m Idea: Average together observed sample values
= Act according to z

m Every time you visit a state, write down what the
sum of discounted rewards turned out to be from
that state until the end of the episode (called
the expected reward-to-go):

samplei(s) = R(s)+yR(s')+y?R(s )+.

DOvBLE

 

m Average those samples: vV(s) =< â€”). sample,(s)

m This is called direct or Monte-Cano evaluation
