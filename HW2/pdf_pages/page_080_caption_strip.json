  "summary": "The slide explains the Reflexion process, detailing the roles of the Actor, Evaluator, and Self-Reflection model in producing and evaluating a trajectory. The process involves the Actor interacting with the environment, the Evaluator computing a score, and the Self-Reflection model analyzing the set of trajectory and score to produce a summary. This summary is stored in memory and serves as verbal feedback for each trial."
