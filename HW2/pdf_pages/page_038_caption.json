<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Text to Image Generation with Diffusion Based Models",
  "definitions": {
    "Diffusion Process": "Diffusion models are inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics. For a small fraction of the time, it is difficult to determine whether particles are moving in the direction of mixing or in the opposite direction."
  },
  "formulas": [],
  "keywords": ["Diffusion", "Process", "Non-equilibrium thermodynamics", "Particles", "Mixing"],
  "summary": "The slide discusses the diffusion process in the context of text to image generation using diffusion-based models. It explains that these models are inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics and highlights the difficulty in determining the direction of particle movement during mixing."
