Problems with Direct Evaluation

 

g What's good about direct evaluation?                        Output Values
m It's easy to understand
m It doesn’t require any knowledge of T,R

a It eventually computes the correct average values,
using just sample transitions

a What bad about it?

a It wastes information about state connections

= Need to have all episodes ahead of time (cannot
“stream” in transitions)

 

lf Band Eboth go to C
under this policy, how can
their values be different?
