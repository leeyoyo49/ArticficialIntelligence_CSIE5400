<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Discounting",
  "definitions": {
    "discount": "Each time we descend a level, we multiply in the discount once"
  },
  "formulas": [
    "U([1,2,3]) = 1*1 + 0.5*2 + 0.25*3 = 2.75",
    "U([3,2,1]) = 1*3 + 0.5*2 + 0.25*1 = 5.25",

  ],
  "keywords": [
    "discount",
    "utility",
    "convergence",
    "algorithm",
    "reward"
  ],
  "summary": "The slide explains the concept of discounting in the context of utility maximization. It provides a method for discounting, reasons for its use, and an example calculation. The example shows that the utility of a sequence of rewards is affected by the order in which they are received, and that discounting helps algorithms converge."
