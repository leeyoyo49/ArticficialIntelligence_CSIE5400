  "summary": "The slide discusses the concept of Model-Based Learning, which involves learning an approximate model based on experiences and solving for values as if the model were correct. It outlines two steps: learning an empirical MDP model by counting outcomes and normalizing them, and solving the learned MDP, possibly using value iteration."
