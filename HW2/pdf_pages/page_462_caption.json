<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json

    "Reinforcement learning": "an AI area concerned with how an intelligent agent ought to take actions in a dynamic environment in order to maximize the cumulative reward.",
    "Supervised learning": "not needing labelled input/output pairs to be presented, reinforcement learning focuses on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge) with the goal of maximizing the long term reward."

  "keywords": [
    "Reinforcement learning",

  "summary": "The slide discusses reinforcement learning, a subset of machine learning, which differs from supervised learning by not requiring labeled input/output pairs. It emphasizes the balance between exploration and exploitation to maximize long-term rewards. Visual examples of unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning are provided."
