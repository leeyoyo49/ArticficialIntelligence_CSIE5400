<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json

  "title": "Policy Iteration",
  "definitions": {
    "Policy Iteration": "A method used in reinforcement learning where the policy is iteratively improved. The agent evaluates the current policy and then updates it to maximize the expected return."
  },
  "formulas": [
    "V(s) = \sum_{a \in A} \pi(a|s) \cdot R(s, a) + \gamma \sum_{s' \in S} P(s'|s, a) \cdot V(s')"

  "keywords": [

  "summary": "The slide presents the concept of Policy Iteration in reinforcement learning, where an agent iteratively improves its policy to maximize the expected return. It includes a formula for calculating the value function V(s) based on the current policy \pi(a|s), the reward function R(s, a), and the discount factor \gamma."
