<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json

    "SE": "Self-Improvement"
  },
  "formulas": [
    "w/o SE: the answer is a directly deterministic output of the LLM.",
    "w/ SE: LLM generates an answer and evaluates its correctness. If the evaluation indicates the answer is incorrect, LLM re-generates an answer as the final output."

  "summary": "The slide discusses two answer generation strategies for LLMs, comparing their performance in various tasks with and without self-improvement. The strategies include direct deterministic output and iterative evaluation and re-generation for correctness."
