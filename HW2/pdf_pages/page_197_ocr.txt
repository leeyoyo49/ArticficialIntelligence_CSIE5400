An Example of Coding (Codeforces task) (1/3)

Our Prompt: Self-generate Exemplars + Knowledge

Your goal is to write Python3 code to solve competitive programming problems. Given a problem, explain the core concepts in it and provide
other relevant problems. Then solve the original problem.

# Problem:
You are given a sequence a_l, a_2, .., a_n. Each element of a is 1 or 2. Find out if an integer k exists so that the following conditions are
met. 1 < k <n-1, and al - a_2... a_k = a_{kt1} .. a_n. If there exist multiple k that satisfy the given condition, print the smallest.

# Instruction:

## Algorithms:
Identify the core concepts or algorithms used to solve the problem.

## Tutorial:
Write a tutorial about these algorithms.

## Example Problems:
Provide three examples of relevant competitive programming problems that involve these algorithms. For each problem, describe the problem,
explain the solution in detail, and then write the correct Python3 code.

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:
- Explanation of the solution:
- Python3 code to solve the problem:
