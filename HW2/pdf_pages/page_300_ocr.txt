Adversarial Distribution Matching

¢ This paper proposes a novel approach that reformulates distribution
matching as an adversarial minmax optimization problem.

¢ We maximize the discrepancy measure to define a robust discrepancy metric,
parameterized by a neural network 山.

Concurrently, we minimize the discrepancy between the synthetic dataset D~
and the real dataset D by optimizing the synthetic data distribution D™.

Formally, this minmax optimization problem is expressed as:

min max L(D, D, f, v)
D YY

where L denotes the discrepancy measure, f is the feature extractor network,
and wW is the network learning the discrepancy metric.

This minmax framework seeks the optimal synthetic data distribution D~ that
minimizes L while network W maximizes L to establish a robust metric.
