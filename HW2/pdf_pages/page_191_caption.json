1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples
2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.
3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.
4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:

A pioneering study utilized natural language rationales to solve

small steps.          Probe:

Question: Two trains running in opposite directions cross a
man standing on the platform in 27 seconds and 17 seconds
respectively and they cross each other in 23 seconds. The ratio

In this study, a model is        of their speeds is:
