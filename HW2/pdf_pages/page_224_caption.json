¢ Multimodal-CoT is a proposed mechanism to incorporate language (text)
and vision (images) modalities into a two-stage framework that

separates rationale generation and answer inference.
¢ Both stages share the same model structure but differ in the input and output.

The first stage involves rationale generation, and the second stage involves answer inference. Both stages share the same model structure but differ in input and output. The slide also includes a visual representation of the process and a question-answer example."
