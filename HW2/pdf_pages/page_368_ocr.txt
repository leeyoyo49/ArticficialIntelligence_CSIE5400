Utilities for a Fixed Policy

 

m Define the utility of astate s, under a fixed policy z:
V"(s) = expected total discounted rewards starting in s and following zr

= What is the recursive relation?

 

V*(s) = max > T(s, a, s’)  [R(s, a,s’) + yVv*(s')|

mw Answer:

V"(s) =) T(s,7(s),5')[R(s, 1(s), 8°) + Vs]
