  "summary": "The slide discusses the concept of diffusion process in the context of text to image generation using diffusion based models. It explains that the movement of a single molecule on a very short time scale follows a Gaussian distribution, and this applies to both the direction of mixing and its opposite. The slide also includes a diagram illustrating the diffusion process and a mathematical formula related to it."
