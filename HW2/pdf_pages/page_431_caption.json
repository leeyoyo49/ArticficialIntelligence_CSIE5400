<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json

    "Experience Replay": "Instead of running Q-learning on state/action pairs as they occur during simulation or the actual experience, we 'replay' the stored data [state, action, reward, next_state]."

  "summary": "The slide discusses a technique called 'Experience Replay' used in Q-learning to handle constantly changing inputs and outputs. It explains that instead of running Q-learning on state/action pairs as they occur, the data is replayed. An example is given of building a video game bot, where each frame of the game represents a different state, and a random batch of frames is sampled during training."
