Policies

 

m In deterministic single-agent search problems,
we wanted an optimal plan, or sequence of
actions, from start to a goal

m= For MDPs, we want an optimal policy 7*: SA
m Apolicy gives an action for each state

ms Anoptimal policy is one that maximizes
expected utility if followed

= Anexpilicit policy defines a reflex agent
