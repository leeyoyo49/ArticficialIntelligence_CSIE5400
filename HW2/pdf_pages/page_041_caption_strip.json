  "summary": "The slide discusses Denoising Diffusion Models, which consist of two processes: the Forward diffusion process that gradually adds noise to input, and the Reverse denoising process that learns to generate data by denoising. The slide includes a visual representation of the Forward diffusion process and the Reverse denoising process, showing the progression from data to noise and back to data."
