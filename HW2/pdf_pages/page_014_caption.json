<|im_start|>system<|im_sep|>You are an AI lecture slide analyzer. The following input is an image and the OCR of a lecture slide about “Artificial Intelligence.”

1. Extract every piece of written content:
   • Slide title
   • Sub-bullets and their full text
   • Definitions, formulas, and any inline examples

2. The summary should be as thorough and precise as possible—this will be used for later retrieval and generation.

3. The keywords should be the most relevant terms from the slide, containing at least 5 terms.

4. Organize your output as a valid JSON object with these fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "definitions": { term: definition },
     "formulas": [ string ],
     "keywords": [ string ],
     "summary": string
   }

5. Output ONLY the JSON object as a string—no extra text or formatting.

6. The JSON object should be valid and parsable.<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>```json
{
  "title": "Example: Image Captioning with Transformers",
  "definitions": {
    "Image Captioning": "The process of generating textual descriptions for images.",
    "Transformer": "A type of model architecture used in deep learning for tasks such as language translation and image captioning."
  },
  "formulas": [
    "y = y1, y2, ..., yT",

  "keywords": [
    "Image Captioning",

    "Encoder",
    "Sequence"
  ],
  "summary": "The slide provides an example of image captioning using a transformer model. It includes a diagram showing the flow from input image to output caption, with a transformer encoder and decoder. The encoder processes the image into a sequence of tokens, which the decoder then uses to generate a caption."
